The two earUest appearances of tribal art in the advertising pages of the Magazine must be viewed more generaUy as part of the interest in antiques and fancy goods supposed of its readers by advertisers, which ranged at that time from the much more visible, numerous and consistendy present advertise ments for Chinese (and to a lesser extent Japanese) decora tive art and oriental carpets, to Steinway pianos and Kodak photographic suppUes - aU expensive and aU Unked to the leisurely pursuit of culture.

As Christopher Green has pointed out, for Fry 'the \"primitive\" was not ... a threat to Western culture; it offered the stimulus for rebuilding in broader terms of the European tradition'.7 Unlike other notionally primitive art forms, tribal objects from West Africa, Oceania and North America could not be recuperated by appealing to their status as historical relics. Aside from the fine bronze work removed from Benin City as a result of the British 'punitive expedition' in February 1897, which was generally seen as archaeological8 ? that is, as representative of a past 'civilisation' since degenerated - objects from these geographical areas were viewed as the products of cultures both presentistic (or ahistorical) and in a state of 'barbarism' preceding civilisation.9 In the Social Darwinist models of evolution that were still current in the first part of the last century, they occupied a place at the wellsprings of cultural development. In this way they were simultaneously both contemporary and 'ancient'. Lacking a history that could be mapped against genealogies of development based on a European evolutionist cultural ology, they were situated inevitably outside art-historical discourse. The reappraisal and admittance of tribal objects into European art history was only made possible by shifts in the language of criticism of contemporary European modernist art itself. If 'Primitive' and modernist art are mutually supportive in the pages of the burlington magazine in its first three decades, in the absence of a sense of history, tribal art had to accord in the first place with the present. Artistic interest in tribal art only really began to gain ground around 1905, in Paris, and then among a relatively small social group. There were some early artist-collectors in Britain, notably Jacob Epstein, and by 1912 Fry himself was aware of African sculpture and may have begun to acquire examples.10 However, the broader acceptance of tribal works as autonomous objects of art-historial study only occurred after the First World War. The immediate post war period witnessed a surge of interest in tribal art in Europe, largely as a result of the modernist credentials that had begun to accrue to it as recognition of its role deepened in the development of a Post-Impressionist aesthetic. At the forefront was Picasso's interest, demonstrated in the appropri ations of his so-called 'Negro period' around 1907-09, but by 1919 more obvious appropriations of tribal forms had begun to appear, especially in commercial art in France, as well as the proliferation of exhibitions devoted to tribal art itself.11 THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE CXLVI FEBRUARY 2OO4 99 7 C.

Epstein was an early and enthusiastic collector of African art, often paying high prices for important pieces, whereas Fry's acquisitions of tribal art were sporadic and relatively few. 11 For some of the key early documents dealing with tribal art in the context of modernism, seej.

       "  NON-EUROPEAN ART IN THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE BEFORE 1930 If modern art was ultimately to provide validation for tribal art, it was itself validated at least partly through com parison with other non-European and primitive art; none of the twenty-seven articles covering the modern movement published in THE BURLINGTON magazine before 1920 men tions tribal art. Yet, as late as 1911, Laurence Binyon, in tions tribal art. Yet, as late as 1911, Laurence Binyon, in praising the opening of a new museum for art of the Far praising the opening of a new museum for art of the Far East, still felt the need to remind his readers that the 'arts of China and Japan, so long regarded as merely decorative and industrial, and relegated to the ethnographical sections of museums, have at last begun to be a serious study'.12 This shift in value was, at least in part, caused by the same sus tained disillusionment with European culture and a search for other art histories by cultural modernisers which was later to fuel the 'invention' of tribal art. More specifically, the idea of tribal art arises out of a primitivising attitude which characteristically saw recent European culture and its fine and decorative arts as creatively exhausted and crippled by sophistication; it is part of a wider search for primal mod els for cultural renewal. That the burlington magazine contributed to the spread of these kinds of ideas is without doubt. Arthur Clutton-Brock's 1911 article on 'The \"Prim itive\" tendency in Modern Art' tackles the subject head-on: 'A good deal of ridicule has been provoked by the efforts of some modern painters to attain to a childish na?vet? but these efforts are very like the early Christian efforts in morals .... So nowadays we have grown stale in art; we try to do too much, and waste our powers upon what is not essential. Our own past is a burden to us, not because its art was bad, but because ... we feel the same need in art as the Christians felt in morals to begin again from the beginning.'13 But it is clear that the 'primitive' to which he refers is European: 'the word primitive . . . makes us think at once of the early Italians.' And, perhaps, of Byzantium: 'Gradually a primitive, living and expressive art ousted the mechanical inexpressive art of the [Roman] empire.'14 Elsewhere, Fry himself had earlier defended charges that modern art, as represented by the works in his first Post-Impressionist exhibition in London in 1910, was 'barbaric' and 'regressive' in very similar terms. In answer to his critics, he asked rhetorically why modern artists should 'wilfully return to primitive, or... barbaric art', and answered that it was 'necessary' if art was to become once again unencumbered by formulas and dogmatism and 'regain its power to express emotional ideas'.15 Significandy, though, direct influence is also characteristically denied. For art to be challenging and valid in this scheme of things, it must not be stylistically derivative. Thus Clutton-Brock argued, 'the simplified art of the present is promising because it... is not archaistically primitive; and that is the reason why it shocks and surprises us. We can put up with imitation primitive art, because its originals have prepared us for it. . ..'l6 26. An Egyptian and an Indian figure illustrating E.B. Havell's article 'The Symbolism of Indian Sculpture and Painting', the burlington magazine 15 (1909), p.336. Among non-European peoples, the qualities of simplici ty and freedom to which critics aspired were first read into the arts of China and Japan. A 1910 editorial in the Maga zine declared that in Europe, 'we are more disillusioned, more tired with our own tradition' than ever before, but suggested that: 'To us the art of the East presents the hope of discovering a more spiritual, more expressive idea of design.'1? the burlington magazine is notable from the beginning for its intelligent and detailed coverage of non Western arts in general, notably from China, Japan and India.18 In the case of the decorative arts it is particularly rich in its coverage of textiles and carpets, mosdy from the near East.19 But direct comparisons between European and non Western art are most persistent in the areas of painting and sculpture. In 1905, for example, in an article dealing specif ically with the relationship between European and Japanese art, which prefigured Fry's and Clutton-Brock's later state ments, Charles Holmes extolled the virtues of 'sensitivity' and 'suggestiveness' in Japanese art, as against what he saw as the dogged, over-laboured 'realism' of European painting: 'Elaboration and realism . . . come as naturally to European painters as do swiftness and suggestiveness to the Oriental.'20 In his argument, the much vaunted conceptual qualities of rationalism and materialism that were more usually used to explain the advancement of western 'civilisation' were IOO FEBRUARY 2004 CXLVI THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE 12 L.

This was followed, between100continuous tone image\n",
       "  NON-EUROPEAN ART IN THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE BEFORE 1930 turned against it. 'One might almost describe the difference between the art of the East and the art of the West', he argues, 'by saying that while Europeans are concerned with the aspect of things, Orientals are concerned with their vitality.'Japanese artists are praised for their essentially emo tional response to phenomena; their desire to communicate to the spectator 'the living force in man and in nature'.21 Sig nificandy, however, Holmes sets the 'primitive' qualities of nificandy, however, Holmes sets the 'primitive' qualities of 'classical' Chinese and Japanese art ? simplicity and sugges 'classical' Chinese and Japanese art ? simplicity and sugges tiveness - against the 'highly cultured' level of its spectators; artists in China and Japan could rely on 'an audience ready to take up the simplest suggestion of natural objects and endow that suggestion with a fertile embroidery of reminis cence'.22 In contradistinction, Holmes suggests that a Euro pean audience is less receptive to 'expression', but more demanding of practical qualities of craftsmanship and tech nical exactitude, one that 'has to be led every step of the way and to have every detail explained to it'.2^ Crucially, though, we can presume that implicit in Holmes's critique of the sensibility of the European spectator is an invitation to the reader of the burlington magazine to regard himself as the exception to this rule. Chinese and Japanese calligraphy is once again brought to bear on an analysis of modern European drawing in a two part article by Fry from the end of the War. Yet, in retro spect, the works by Modigliani, Gaudier-Brzeska and even Matisse which illustrate the article would have lent them selves well to comparison with African sculpture.24 In a review article on pre-Columbian art, Fry not only strongly asserted the new artistic importance of Aztec and Maya sculpture, 'discovered' after being seen for centuries as scientific curiosities, but he also pointed out that 'some of our modern artists have even gone to them for inspiration'. Characteristically he attributed this transformation to 'the general aesthetic awakening which has followed on the revolt against the tyranny of the Graeco-Roman tradition'.2* In spite of all this, Fry seemingly could not resist bringing the subject back to Chinese art, and specifically to his sup port for 'the theory of influence from Eastern Asia' in pre Columbian culture, which is defended primarily on grounds of formal affinity or, as he put it, 'the curious likeness in general treatment of naturalistic forms in early Chinese and American art'.26 Similarly, in a famous article on 'Bushman Paintings', Fry once again insinuated a connection with modernism through the Far East: 'Japanese drawings . . . approach more nearly than those of any other civilized people to the immediacy and rapidity of transcription of Bushman and Palaeolithic art .... It is partly due to Japan ese influence that our own Impressionists have made an attempt to get back to that ultra-primitive directness of vision ? they deliberately sought to de-conceptualize art.

The artist of to-day has therefore to some extent a choice before him of whether he will think form like the early artists of European races or merely see it like the Bushmen.'27 In view of this, it is tempting to see as more than fortuitous the juxtaposition, for example, of TJ. Larkin's advertisement for early Chinese art and Persian pottery with one for Fry's Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition,28 or Lai-Yuan's for 'Chinese Antiquities' with one for Fry's Omega Pottery (Fig.27). Indeed, that Chinese and Japanese art was for long a crucial bridge between European and 'savage' arts is sug gested by its continued appearance in lists of the develop ment of a 'modern' sensibility. In 1917, for example, Fry argued that, 'students of the history of art . . . have gradual ly been forced by their critical faculty out of the narrow grooves of the old aesthetic orthodoxy, and ... have learned successively to accept with delight, first Gothic art, then the painting of the primitives and the early miniaturists, then the Byzantines, then early Oriental art, and finally Aztec and THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE CXLVI FEBRUARY 2004 101 October 1905 and March 1906, by a three-part article on the classification of oriental carpets; and between 1903 and 1930 more than a dozen articles on non European textiles were published. 20 CJ.

The arts of India, China, and Japan were \"curiosities\", the interest in African and other \"savage\" carvings was purely ethnological . . . but to the present generation is due the discovery of the aesthetic aspect of African and primitive American culture.'30 1920 saw the publication of a landmark article in THE burlington magazine by Andr? Salmon, whose creden tials as an intimate member of the most advanced Parisian artistic circles must have injected a profound air of authen ticity to his statements about 'Negro art' and its place in the modernist canon. The piece was well illustrated with African and Oceanic objects from the collections of Paul Guillaume and the British Museum (Fig.28). No apologetic preliminaries are aired here - in African sculpture, Salmon writes, we have an art that 'is admirable through its balance, its nobility of form, its sum of naked beauty'.31 In common with much of the criticism in the pages of the Magazine, Salmon emphasises 'emotional' qualities as against technical and mimetic ones, allying tribal art most closely perhaps with the supposed inherent expressiveness of European medieval sculpture: 'That which allows the black sculptor to achieve the divine in his interpretations of the human face is his plastic translation of emotion, preferably at its most intense instant.'32 Perhaps unsurprisingly, his analysis main tains close connections between modernist European prac tice and the 'example' of tribal art - indeed it was not until 1940 that an article appeared in the Magazine which consid ered African art autonomously, and even then the author, the painter Richard Carline, felt the need to first disabuse readers of the idea that this was merely an art 'associated with the French dealers'.33 That tribal art was seen from the beginning as part of the history of recent European art is underscored by the fact that Salmon authenticated it through modern art, which in turn was authenticated through tribal art. For the timid viewer, he suggested, it 'might be better before seeing the collections at the British Museum or the Trocadero ... to study the creations of the modern artists who were the first to place Negro art on a plane not inferior to that of Grecian, mediaeval, or Ancient Egyptian art'.34 He was also clear that it was 'Negro sculpture' which provided lessons for artists suffering from a profound cultural 'anguish'; Picasso, Derain, Matisse and Vlaminck were, he said, 'irresistibly drawn towards an art, primitive indeed in a sense, but already highly developed, un-shadowed by any Academy, or by any Renaissance. Such an art, if its logic were studied, was capable of reviving the dried-up sources of the classic.'35 102 FEBRUARY 2004 * CXLVI THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE 29 Fry, op. cit. (note 2), p.225. 30 See W.

       "  NON-EUROPEAN ART IN THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE BEFORE 1930 Salmon's stated position in relation to the tribal and the modern found confirmation in advertisements in the Magazine around this time. With the end of the War came renewed activity by French galleries who began once again to advertise. Remarkably for a periodical that was not primarily modernist in its articles, in every issue between September 1919 and July 1921 L?once Rosenberg placed a full-page advertisement for his Galerie 'L'Effort Moderne', and Paul Guillaume advertised throughout 1920, conscious ly mixing the tribal and modern (Fig. 29). Salmon had used an exhibition at the Galerie Devambez in Paris in 1919 and a f?te n?gre organised by the dealer Paul Guillaume as the a f?te n?gre organised by the dealer Paul Guillaume as the starting point for his article. More or less simultaneously Fry starting point for his article. More or less simultaneously Fry also published a piece on African art in the Athenaeum, in response to an exhibition mainly of objects from Guil laume's collection at London's Chelsea Book Club.36 Yet, in spite of his enthusiasm for the work itself, Fry was unable to display the same unconditional delight in African culture implicit in Salmon's text. Fry remained, as Christopher Green has pointed out, curiously wedded to 'simplistic gen eralizations and the focus on racial stereotypes dominant in British attitudes to Africa at the time'.37 This meant that he was able to claim that some of the African works 'are great sculpture - greater, I think, than anything we produced even in the Middle Ages',38 while questioning the very pos sibility of development or even a real sense of cultural iden tity: 'It is curious that a people who produced such great artists did not produce also a culture in our sense of the word.'39 These artists had 'the most exquisite sensibility and the finest taste', he argued, but what was missing was the self-critical faculty that 'distinguishes civilized peoples'. Then, in a strange discursive turn he both reveals his prefer ence for early Chinese culture and seemingly blames Africa rather than Europe for the hitherto negative reception of its material culture: 'if we imagined such an apparatus of criti cal appreciation as the Chinese have possessed from the earli est times [my italics] applied to Negro art, we should have no difficulty in recognising its singular beauty. We should never have been tempted to regard it as savage or unrefined.'40 Fry's ambivalence found voice only tangentially into the pages of the burlington magazine, in W.G. Constable's rather dismissive review from 1921 of another exhibition of African art at the Goupil Gallery, in which he dwells on the fragility of 'pure' African production. While dismissing attempts to construct histories of African art, he also claims that 'earlier Negro Art has a fantastic dignity of which even museums and exhibitions cannot rob it; but later manifesta tions have not been able to survive European influence'.41 Tribal art was part of a number of 'non-naturalistic' cultur al forms that were regarded as in some way primitive in the early twentieth century, from folk art to pre-Columbian and early Asian art.42 It is clear from coverage given in the Mag azine that these various artefacts and, to some extent, the Selected Works by ANDRE DERAIN, HENRI-MATISSE, PICASSO, MODIGLIANI, MARIE . lAURENCIN, RENOIR, GAUGUIN, BONNARD, VLAMINGK, etc bine Specimens of Negro Sculpture.

As Green points out, 'the notion of civilization' was always at the centre of Fry's 'set of values'.43 There is never a serious challenge to 'civilised' values, nor to the supremacy of the western canon (although it is one that is reconstructed to marginalise the 'Graeco-Roman' tradi tion). Art history, in this model, is predicated in Aristotelian terms as a cycle of cultural renewals, not so much a history of regressions but rather of returns to a point at which forward movement is once again possible. From the beginning, the 'antiquarian' interests of THE BURLINGTON magazine led to articles on non-European subjects, and its generally 'pre-Raphaelite' position meant that the art of the European Primitives was also generously covered. I have argued that Chinese and Japanese art play an important mediatory role between the 'civilised' and the 'primitive' in the pages of the Magazine. However, another occasional presence is also of crucial importance, namely the child. Like Far Eastern art, children's drawings were consis tendy used as familiar markers in treatments of 'inartistic' subjects. Thus, in 'Bushman Paintings', even as he struggles to account for the essential difference of this work to other primitive models, Fry declares: 'The primitive drawing of our own race is singularly like that of children .... The child does, of course, know that the figure thus drawn is not like a man, but it is a kind of hieroglyphic script for a man, and THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE CXLVI FEBRUARY 2004 103 in which Salmon's article appeared. In addition to 'Negro Sculpture', it also lists 'Peruvian Pottery', although there is no mention of this confluence in Fry's review. 37 Green, op. dt. (note 7), p. 136. 38 Fry 1920, op. dt.

       "  NON-EUROPEAN ART IN THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE BEFORE ?930 satisfies his desire for expression. Precisely the same phe nomenon occurs in primitive art . . .. The [primitive] artist does not seek to transfer a visual sensation to paper, but to express a mental image which is coloured by his conceptual habits.'44 Elsewhere, he says that 'children's drawings are genuine examples of primitive art' (Fig. 30) and, like chil dren, 'the primitive artist is intensely moved by events and objects, and ... his art is the direct expression of his wonder and delight in them'.45 This is not the case, Fry claims, for contemporary European adults whose self-consciousness prevents them from retaining the 'intimacy and sharpness of notation, the impr?vu quality of primitive art'.46 Such claims are made possible by employing a sociologi cal extrapolation of the German scientist Ernst Haeckel's cal extrapolation of the German scientist Ernst Haeckel's 'biogenetic law' which states that the 'history of the embryo 'biogenetic law' which states that the 'history of the embryo is an expression of the history of its lineage; or in other words: Ontogeny is a recapitulation of phylogeny'.47 By extension, it could be suggested that what the child is to the adult, 'primitive' society is to 'civilised' society. Also implicit in this is the Darwinian idea that evolution always proceeds from the relatively simple and undifferentiated towards complexity and specialisation. In this way the child emerges as the 'primitive' par excellence around which other notions of the 'savage' and 'primitive' culture revolve, creating a taxonomy of primitivity that connects disparate artefacts and helps render them amenable to formalist critique. This is admirably demonstrated in G. Baldwin Brown's 1922 article in the Magazine on the origin of the arts, in which he conflates history and evolutionism: 'The earliest phenomena of art are partly to be studied among primitive peoples of the modern world, who, like the Aus tralian aborigines, the almost extinct Bushmen of Africa, or the Eskimo, are still in the hunter stage.' Such expression, he says, demonstrates essentials, for 'painting and sculpture aim not at copying nature, but at producing an aesthetic impres sion'.48 Thus, technical virtuosity ? which is associated with complexity and specialisation - is regarded at best as anteri or to that which is proper to art, and untutored expression is privileged. As Fry put it: 'We have to recognise that our admiration of an artist's skill is not aesthetic .... We have to get rid of the idea that our favourable aesthetic judgement of a work of art is a kind of prize conferred on the artist for meritorious effort.'49 A sense of a longing for the primitive recurs consistendy in the pages of the burlington magazine in its first three 3o.

For example, an editorial of 1922 reminds readers that: 'Our complex culture is demanding for its sustenance a more and more intimate experience of the simplest and remotest manifestations of man's emotional and intellectual life.'50 Yet, even before Fry's death in 1934, the Magazine seems to have pulled back from its modernist position. Surprisingly, this remained true of the years of Herbert Read's editorship (1933-39). In spite of his own impeccable modernist credentials and writing on contemporary art and its relationship to non-European models in other publica tions,51 Read's period at the Magazine coincides with a dearth of this kind of material. Instead, to find the legacy of the Magazine's influential earUer contribution, we have to look forward to a remarkable exhibition staged at the then fledgling Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, in which Read was closely involved, and which brought together tribal, prehistoric and contemporary western art in order to demonstrate, as Read wrote, 'the universality of art, and, more particularly, the eternal recurrence of certain phenomena in art which, on their appearance, are labelled \"modern\"'. In many ways reminiscent of Fry, the exhibi tion was entided 40,000 Years of Modem Art.52 104 FEBRUARY 2004 CXLVI THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE 44 Fry 1910, op. dt. (note 27), p.334. 45 Fry, op. dt. (note 29), p.226. 46 Ibid. The argument is further developed in a review of an exhibition of chil dren's drawings at the Independent Gallery; R. Fry: 'Children's Drawings', the burlington magazine 44 (1924), pp.3 5-41. The exhibition consisted of work made under the guidance of the art teacher Marion Richardson by her pupils at Dudley High School, Birmingham (a few years earlier, pupils had contributed to a show of drawings at Fry's Omega Workshops, February-March 1917). Fry viewed Richardson's methods as revolutionary because they preserved, he believed, the 'natural' state of vision and its expressive translation. Fry's interest in Richardson's methods is discussed in 'Expanding the Canon', in Green, op. dt. (note 7), pp. 128-29. 47 E.

Fry himself introduces an interesting dimension of class division into the discussion, even as he suggests the relative universality of the child's vision. In the West Mid lands, which he describes as an 'artistically arid and waterless desert of modern life', he says, '[Marion Richardson] has shown that quite average children of lower middle class parents . . . have in them the same kind of feeling about the life and nature of their surroundings as the primitive artists of, say, fifteenth-century Italy'; Fry, op. dt.

       "  'A more and more important work': Roger Fry and The Burlington Magazine by CAROLINE ELAM by CAROLINE ELAM CAS VA, National Gallery of Art, Washington CAS VA, National Gallery of Art, Washington THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN Roger Fry (Fig.3) and the British art establishment was an extremely complex one. In 1911, having just turned down the directorship of the Tate Gallery, he wrote to his mother: 'So I must give up the idea of official life and titles and honours, which I very willingly do ... I once wanted those things but I now feel quite indif- ferent to them.\" Although he was much involved with founding and advising - even interfering with - institutions, he was not by nature an institutional figure, and he disliked committees.2 But there was one institution with which Fry's association could hardly have been closer or more enduring, and that was THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE. He was inti- mately concerned with the plans for the new journal in 1902, he was a hyper-active member of its Consultative Committee from the first issue in March 1903 until his death, he was co-editor from 19o09 to 1919, and he almost single-handedly saved the Magazine from financial ruin in 1903-o6.3 On 6th March 1911 he again wrote to his mother of the Burlington: 'although it pays me very little it is getting to be a more and more important work and one that I have much at heart.'4 Although Fry's relationship with the Burlington has been much written about,s the lack of an archive at the Magazine for the years before the I920s means that his r6le in its foundation and early years cannot yet be tracked in detail. In his elegant and unsurpassed brief history of the Magazine, Benedict Nicolson predicted: 'The author of the centenary volume in 2003 will be hard put to it to provide a coherent account of our history unless a great many relevant letters are published in the meantime.'6 Alas, no such trove has been unearthed and we are still lacking answers to the questions Nicolson posed then: 'who had the first idea . . . who thought of the title and why [was it] chosen?'7 Partly because of the huge posthumous interest in Fry and his circle, his rtle in the Magazine's foundation has come to seem the predominant one. But far more credit for the 'first idea' than Nicolson would allow should surely be given to 3. Roger Fry in front of his mural in the loggia at Failand, his parents' home near Bristol. c.I897.

Holmes later guine . . . happy-go-lucky' group (as C.J. Holmes later described them) who worked for the Connoisseur, a journal described them) who worked for the Connoisseur, a journal which had been founded two years before the Burlington, in 1901; he and others seceded the following year to set up THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE.9 Like the Burlington, the Connoisseur experienced major financial problems soon after it started, and Dell (having worked on the Evening News) had been promoted there by Alfred Harmsworth, later Lord Northcliffe, when he took over the publication.'o The Connoisseur was subtitled 'An Illustrated Magazine for Collectors\"' and dealt with a predictable range of col- lectables dear to the Edwardian era - Sheffield plate, mez- zotints, old oak and so on. It published articles on notable collectors, often prefaced with alarming full-page photog- raphic portraits of them. While firmly declaring 'with con- temporary art we have nothing to do', it sported a cover and vignettes by John Byam Shaw and a somewhat hectic and overcrowded design on art paper, with the occasional garish tipped-in colour plate or pseudo-original etching.12 But amid the undergrowth of articles on 'Old lace and how to collect it' or 'The Imperial Crown of Edward VII', there were stirrings of something different: not only serious pieces by Campbell Dodgson on aspects of the history of prints, but, for example, a lengthy two-part account by Bernard Berenson of the Morelli collection at Bergamo, emblematic of the new school of connoisseurship.'3 It seems likely that Dell, who himself contributed a two-part article on Michael Tonkinson's Japanese collection at Franche Hall, Worcestershire,'4 had rapidly sensed the possibility of a new kind of British art publication - one which would occupy, as he wrote in the Burlington's first editorial, 'the same posi- tion as the leading art periodicals on the continent', devot- ed to the 'serious and disinterested study of ancient art'.'5 What were these leading continental art periodicals in 1902-03, and which, if any, did the Burlington take as its model?'6 The longest established was the Gazette des Beaux- Arts, founded in 1859 by Charles Blanc as a 'Courrier Europeen de l'art de la curiosite'. In 1903 this was maintaining its position as a serious, reflective, reasonably well-illustrat- edjournal with an international coverage. Its authorship was largely confined to the leading French art historians and crit- / . ! C~e~'S aL~r~~s 4.

       "  ROGER FRY AND THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE gleanings from the archives mostly contributed by Cornelius von Fabriczy, with occasional offerings by Georg Gronau or Paul Oskar Kristeller. Bizarrely, however, the Repertorium was virtually devoid of illustrations.\"8 At the opposite pole from the Repertorium in its lavishly ambitious presentation was the Zeitschrift fir bildende Kunst, founded in 1866 and produced by the Leipzig publisher Ernst Arthur Seemann. This was international in its coverage, with a few foreign This was international in its coverage, with a few foreign contributors, and paid serious attention to contemporary art, contributors, and paid serious attention to contemporary art, carrying good-quality tipped-in colour plates and ambitious reproductions of prints. Bode was a regular contributor. Particularly striking for English readers in these years was the series of articles by Hermann Muthesius on 'Kunst und Leben in England'.19 The Burlington's early numbers were in some ways close in their appearance and contents to the Zeitschrift fiir bildende Kunst, although the latter eschewed decorative arts and antiquarianism. Of the Italian periodicals, the most important were the Rome-based L'Arte, founded by Adolfo Venturi in 1898, and Guido Cagnola's Rassegna d'Arte, published in Milan since 1901, both focusing primarily on medieval and renais- sance Italian art. L'Arte carried serious articles and book reviews, covered the major international exhibitions, and had regular 'corrieri artistici dall'estero' by international schol- ars such as Fabriczy, Julius von Schlosser, Tschudi, Guiffrey, Bouchot and, among its English contributors, Herbert Cook, Robert Langton Douglas and Jocelyn Ffoulkes. The Burlington's sections on 'Art in America', 'France', 'Germany' etc. may well have been based on these.20 In its early issues, Rassegna d'Arte had something of the character of a newsletter, with many small notices and a rather scrap- py layout, but it rapidly became a cutting-edge journal for the burgeoning connoisseurship of early Italian art, focusing on new discoveries and attributions. Berenson liked to pub- lish there, and several German, French and English scholars contributed to it, including Ffoulkes, R.H. Cust, F. Mason Perkins and Fry himself.\" Indeed, the internationalism of the world of art publishing at this period is truly remarkable. Like Zeuxis selecting and combining the beauties of the maidens of Croton, the Burlington seems to have aimed at combining features from all these models - the interna- tionalism and positivistic document-based approach of the Repertorium, the beautiful production values and (later) the receptiveness to contemporary art of the Zeitschrift, the quality of critical writing of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts, the news from around the world of L'Arte, the new connois- seurship and focus on novitd of the Rassegna d'Arte, as well as the antiquarianism and openness to the decorative arts of the 9.

And there was an additional final element of importance - the Editorials, which were not found in any of the continental models. What is so remarkable is that the pattern or formula so established in 1903 was one that essen- tially stuck. The prospectus of the new Magazine, issued in autumn 1902, laid out its manifesto.22 Considerable effort was devot- ed to distinguishing the Burlington from the Connoisseur: it was not to be 'merely a collector's magazine' and 'the famil- iar rechauff6 of well-known books of reference, the smart but superficial article' was to find no place in its pages. It was to be 'for all amateurs (in the original sense of the term), whether students, collectors or both'. It would chiefly be devoted to the art of the past, but 'contemporary art will not be ignored'. It would aim at conveying 'information of solid and permanent value', and the firmness of the Magazine's foundations was emphasised with a listing of thirty-one members of a 'Consultative Committee'23 and of the authors 19 H. Muthesius: 'Kunst und Leben in England', Zeitschriftfiir bildende Kunst N.F. 13 (1902), pp.14-21 and 49-69; 14 (1903), PP-73-84. 20 For the 'Art in America' section, see Flaminia Gennari Santori's article in this issue, pp.153-63. 21 It must certainly have been a blow to Fry that Herbert Home finally published there in 1913 his article (initially promised to the Burlington) on the beautiful Botticelli predella in the J.G. Johnson collection, Philadelphia, which Fry had secured for Johnson in 19o8 after it had been turned down by the Metropolitan Museum; see C.B. Strehlke: 'Bernard and Mary Berenson, Herbert P.

The Burlington Fine Art Cluhib's catalogues often listed mem- bers of committees for, and contributors (i.e. lenders) to exhibitions in a somewhat Burlingtonian style.

The committee was a weighty body of aristocratic amateurs (Lord Balcarres, Viscount Dillon, Herbert Cook), academic art historians (Sir Martin Conway, Allan Marquand), present and future museum directors (Wilhelm von Bode, Sir Purdon Clarke, Sir Whitworth Wallis, Sir Claude Phillips, Lionel Cust, Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, Charles Holroyd), and cura- tors (Campbell Dodgson, Sidney Colvin), as well as noted experts on heraldry, furniture, illuminated manuscripts, book illustration and portraiture. There were two women, book illustration and portraiture. There were two women, Julia Frankau and Edith Nevill Jackson - both contributors Julia Frankau and Edith Nevill Jackson - both contributors to the Connoisseur. The Magazine's major backer, Harold Hartley, was also on the committee.24 An inner group of 'Italian advisers', whose involvement is documented in contemporary letters,25 was composed of two expatriate art historians resident in Florence, the American Bernard Berenson and the English Herbert Home, as well as Fry himself. Charles Eliot Norton, the celebrated Harvard professor of art history, was presumably brought in at Berenson's suggestion.26 The hybrid nature of the Burlington's genesis is evident from the list of promised articles, for which around half of the Consultative Committee had evidently been pressed into service. Over a third of the offerings were by contrib- utors to the Connoisseur or had Connoisseur-like subjects. But notable among the other two thirds were products of new research on early Italian, Flemish and German art offered not only by committee members but also by international scholars such as Georg Gronau and the Swedish art histori- an Osvald Siren. Home and Berenson both contributed important articles to the first issues, immediately marking out the Burlington as a heavyweight publication in the fore- front of international scholarship.*27 While a certain careless type of British dilettantism was to be avoided, another more serious aspect of that tradition may have been influential, even on the choice of name for the new publication. In addition to the location of the Magazine's offices at New Burlington Street, London, and the association with Lord Burlington and Burlington House (seat of the Royal Academy of Arts and the Society of Antiquaries), the Burlington Fine Arts Club (founded 1857) was surely important: its focused annual exhibitions of works largely drawn from private collections aroused the interest and admiration of scholars and collectors through- out Europe and America,\"8 and its large-format, beautifully illustrated scholarly catalogues with their goldish-green buckram bindings provided a model to be emulated.

Strong's catalogue of the old-master drawings at Chatsworth in the Magazine would have to deal in detail with errors of attribution, since the Burlington 'as Berenson, Home and I are Italian advisers will, I suppose, go in for attributions so far as they count for aes- thetic appreciation'. Unfortunately, Moore turned for help to Charles Ricketts with results that were unacceptable to Fry (Sutton, p.206). 26 His death was recorded in THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE with an obituary by Henry James (14 (January 1909), pp.201-04) who is said to have been surprised at the exiguousness of the fee (see M.

Fry himself reviewed the first number in the Athenaeum (there were no worries about conflicts of interest in those days), commenting: 'there is a certain amount of fashionable dilettantism and gossip about curiosities, but a large proportion of really valuable contributions to the History of Art.'3s These heady days could not continue and by September 1903 the Magazine was 'in extremis'.36 The publishing house, Savile & Co., went bankrupt and the creditors, chiefly the printers, tried to replace Dell (with the critic D.S. MacColl) behind his back. The story crisis and recovery, and Fry's part in it, than once, most eloquently by C.J. Holmes was brought in by Fry to sort things out.Director of the National Portrait Gallery National Gallery, Holmes had been Fry's art critic on the Athenaeum, and had just contributed cle on Cotman to the Burlington. After been scratched together, it was finally agreed and Dell should be co-editors of a publication sounder and more economical lines, with as Managing Director. In his autobiography tribute to Fry, who was 'simply magnificent' successfully courting wealthy benefactors well-wishers to help the Magazine financially.point the Berensons had thought of taking and editorial stake but, perhaps mercifully, against it.39 Even after Holmes was installed, Fry worked ceaselessly throughout 1904 and 1905 on the Magazine's behalf. In January 1905, when he was lured to America by a group of influential collectors hoping to instal him at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he believed himself to be going there in the service of the Burlington. But, when the real purpose of the invitation became clear, he did not scruple to use it as a lever to raise further capital for the Magazine, successfully securing the help of, among others, J.G. Johnson, J. Pierpont Morgan, Henry Walters, and Henry Clay Frick.40 It was becoming probable that Dell would leave, and Fry expected to take over his co-editorship, but this was forestalled by his appoint- ment as curator of paintings at the Metropolitan, which in turn prevented him from becoming Director of the National Gallery in London.4~ Holmes's editorship not only brought financial viability to the Magazine but also consolidated its position as a seri- ous publication.42 Some of the weaker' Connoisseur-ish' con- tributors faded out. Fry did not forbear to proffer both encouragement and censure. 'I want you to establish a cus- tom, if you will', he wrote to Holmes in August 1904, 'of dining with me once a month to discuss the nature of the next No. but one', and Harold Child remembered, from his days as assistant editor, Holmes's 'long conversations with 32 Asked by Nicolson to comment on the new cover, Kenneth Clark wrote on 22nd January 1948, recalling that Emery Walker, the typographer and publisher who was a member of the original Consultative Committee and supplied the pho- togravures for many years, had said 'the cover of the Burlington was one of those things which were so fundamentally well done that they would never date'. Clark agreed, adding: 'Like everything that Herbert Home ever did, it had a kind of posteritorious distinction' (The Burlington Magazine archives). 33 Sutton, p.203, Fry to Mary Berenson, 30th January 1903. 34 See Levey, op. cit.

Fry by telephone'.43 Holmes did not, however, allow him- self to be browbeaten by Fry's occasionally overbearing interventions. For example, when Fry attempted to get him to withdraw an editorial article endorsing the attribution to Diirer of The artist's father acquired by the National Gallery (Fig. Io), Holmes stuck to his guns and ran the piece, while inviting the contrary views of Fry and others.44 Fry com- mented with some disfavour on the quantity of'bric-a-brac' still included (attracting much-needed advertising), but admitted 'it's better to have bric-a-brac with some good things than nothing at all'.45 Holmes's editorship was rela- tively conservative, favouring articles on British art and showing little sympathy for what we now consider to be the most significant or daring new developments in French painting. He was indeed the author of the anonymous painting. He was indeed the author of the anonymous review in the format of an Editorial castigating 'The Last review in the format of an Editorial castigating 'The Last Phase of Impressionism', to which Fry felt impelled to write his celebrated letter of riposte, defending the artists he was later to term the 'Post-Impressionists'.46 However, Holmes's regular unsigned editorials consoli- dated the Burlington's position as an authoritative voice in the world of museums and public policy towards the visual arts.47 As we have seen, these leaders, already promised in the prospectus,48 were among the Burlington's most distinc- tive features, not found in the continental art periodicals. In the three examples he wrote in his nine already adumbrated many of the themes that up by later editors, but it was above all oped the Magazine's distinctive editorial apparently encouraged in his task by Fry, had seen what an influence the \"Burlington\" and wanted to 'widen its scope by including lems'.49 This was essentially a British tradition, only from newspapers, but from the commentaries nals such as the Athenaeum.s5 The subjects of art works to foreign buyers, the need national museums, the British government's the arts, the mismanagement of the Chantrey National Art-Collections Fund, the role ums, the preservation of buildings - have hundred years. Harold Child's account composition in the editorial office also chord: 'Holmes would hammer out every opinion on every form of it, changing it a When Holmes was appointed Director Portrait Gallery in 1909, succeeding Lionel sight was failing, Fry became co-editor sharing the position with Cust, who Surveyor of the King's Pictures (Fig.12).5s his chance to direct the content of the bullying, but Holmes (op. cit. (note 3), pp.218-20) saw the episode as a victory for himself. There is still no consensus about the portrait. Michael Levey (National Gallery Catalogues. The German School, London 1959, pp.26-32) was disinclined to see it as autograph; the Gallery's current view is that the face alone might be by Diirer; the background, inscription and painting of the hands are puzzling. 45 Sutton, p.218, Fry to R.C. Trevelyan, 5th February 1904. Fry's pithiest state- ment of his anti-ideal for the Burlington is in a letter to Holmes of around December 19o6: 'But now I mean to devote serious attention to the Burlington. No more nonsense for me about original research, serious criticism and such bunkum. Give it to 'em hot and strong I say, The Picture of the Year, How to col- lect Carpet-bags, Alma Tadema at home -, Oh, you'll see' (Holmes, op. cit.

Reed, ed.: A Roger Fry Reader, Chicago and London 1996, pp.72-75. As Sibley points out, Holmes's authorship of the original article is referred to by Fry in a letter to D.S. MacColl of 3rd February 1912 (Sutton, p.354): 'So long ago as March 19o8, I wrote a long letter to the Burlington Magazine, to protest against Holmes's contemptuous tone with regard to C6zanne and Gauguin.' 47 See Holmes, op. cit.

Sending William Rothenstein a copy of the January 1910 issue with Maurice Denis's article on Cezanne (which he had translated), he wrote of his hopes that 'gradually the Burlington may become a real power in that direction'.s3 But just as important for Fry was broaden- ing the treatment of non-Western art, as he wrote in a kind of manifesto editorial saluting the one hundredth issue.s4 He also took the opportunity to write regular articles on early Italian art, publishing some of his best pieces in these years.ss Fry was working for the Magazine only two days a week, but found that his responsibilities were very heavy, as Cust was much occupied with his duties Collection.56 Perhaps it was for this reason February 19I2 they gave up entirely the practice February 19I2 they gave up entirely the practice ing monthly editorials, which was not resumed ing monthly editorials, which was not resumed Tatlock's editorship in 1921.57 After 1913 Fry was becoming more and in the Omega Workshops, and had less time to Burlington. In January 1914 the editorial duo umvirate, as he and Cust were joined by More 1942), who had been assistant editor for some associate of Robert Ross at the Carfax Gallery Fry had many dealings), Adey is now best faithful friend of Oscar Wilde.59 With the onset World War, the Magazine grew leaner and illustrated. Although Fry was much preoccupied Quaker relief in France, as well as with the lished some of his wartime lectures, 'Art in 'The New Movement in Art in its Relation to Life' in the Burlington, as well as significant articles on Gaudier-Brzeska and on children's drawings.60 Gail Sibley has pointed out that the ratio of articles concerned with modem art has never been higher than it was in 1918.6' By the end of the War Fry was anxious to give up his edi- torship of the Burlington (in June 1917 he wrote to Vanessa Bell that it was years since he 'had taken an active part' in it).62 No doubt the desire to spend longer periods of time abroad, especially in France, and a wish to concentrate on his painting, played a part in his decision.63 In October 1918 he had the bizarre notion of inviting the future novelist, Aldous Huxley, to take on the editorship, an offer which was unsurprisingly declined.64 Since Cust had also decided to leave, the next twelve months were very fraught. Fry hoped to get Edward McKnight Kauffer, the American artist and graphic designer who had settled in London in 1914, to become sub-editor,65 but this did not happen, and in March 1919 he was writing to Vanessa Bell of'awful rows about the Burlington'.66 These were only temporarily resolved with the appointment of the eccentric figure C.J. 'Hopey' Hope- Johnstone, first as acting editor and then for eight months (May to December 1920) as Editor. His orientalist leanings are memorably recorded in an etching of him by Augustus John (Fig.13), whose children he had tutored, but his regime at the Burlington was hardly a success.67 53 Sutton, p.327, Fry to Rothenstein, 2ndJanuary I9Io.

       "  ROGER FRY AND THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE Although Fry was no longer Editor, he was still deter- mined to see his own candidate in the chair. In November 1920 he wrote to Marie Mauron: Then I've had to settle the affairs of the Burlington Magazine - there had to be a new editor and that was not easy to accomplish. How I hate committees; one must always find a compromise. But there too, in the end I managed to get the man I thought most fit to manage the editing accepted.68 The man in question was Robert Rattray Tatlock (Fig.II), who had met Fry and his sister Margery during service in the Friends Ambulance Unit at the beginning of the War. He later became the art critic of the Daily Telegraph and his wife, the painter Cecily Hey, was a friend of Walter Sickert, for whom she frequently modelled. It was Tatlock's 'devoted and patient labour' that saw Fry's Vision and Design through the press at exactly this time.69 If he did not prove to be the most distinguished Editor in the Magazine's history, he was probably the most commercially successful. We need not necessarily agree with Benedict Nicolson's observation that necessarily agree with Benedict Nicolson's observation that 'the excellence of editorial content, and financial solvency, 'the excellence of editorial content, and financial solvency, have never gone hand in hand except by chance',70 but it is irresistible to quote it. Fry continued to be an extremely active contributor to the Burlington during his remaining thirteen years of life, publishing new attributions (some of which Tatlock should perhaps have turned down),7' and writing the survey of seventeenth-century art, embarrassingly entitled 'Settecen- tismo', which contains his memorable comparison between Caravaggio and the cinema,; as well as his review articles on the great exhibitions of Flemish and Dutch art and of the Italian exhibition of 1930 at Burlington House.73 His reviews and articles on modern and contemporary art diminish considerably in the post-War Burlington but there were outstanding pieces on Van Gogh, Seurat and Cezanne and his last book review was of Herbert Read's Art Now (May 1934). The Burlington archives, which come into patchy existence in Tatlock's time, also reveal Fry's contin- uing involvement with all aspects of the editorial direction of the Magazine. These included design, which, surprisingly, Fry had left completely untouched during his own regime. In February I922 Tatlock wrote to Eric Gill soliciting his help in I7. Herbert Read, by Howard Coster. 1934. Photograph, half-plate nitrate negative (National Portrait Gallery, London). 'improving the design of the cover of our Magazine'. He added that 'Roger Fry is at present trying to sketch out something suitable', and it was probably Fry who had sug- gested bringing in Gill, a friend of pre-War days whose work as a typographer and sculptor he much admired.74 However, nothing came of the proposed re-design. That same year Tatlock (who himself quite liked to stir things up) had to cope with a classic case of Fry's astonishing propen- sity for fomenting controversy and what he described as 'a general atmosphere of hatred and fury against me among the cultured'.75 Fry had long had semi-jocular public feuds with the painter and critic D.S. MacColl (briefly keeper of the 66 Sutton, p.448, letter of I Ith March I919. Two months later he wrote: 'We are really getting that wretched paper in hand' (p.452, letter of 23rd May). 67 Nicolson, op. cit. (note 3), p.182; see also A.

There are letters in the Fry archive at King's College, Cambridge, to Fry from Hope-Johnstone on his walking tour through Turkey, Bosnia, Montenegro, Syria and Persia in 1913-14, during which he sent textiles and ceram- ics for the Omega Workshops to Fry, who helped him out with intermittent subventions. 68 Sutton, p.498, letter of 23rd November 1920. 69 R.

The wry addendum suggests that such a collaboration might not have been ideal. 75 Sutton, p.448, letter to Vanessa Bell, 1 ith March 1919.

       "  ROGER FRY AND THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE Tate Gallery in 1906 and later keeper of the Wallace Collection from 191I to 1924), who favoured a different strand of contemporary art, detesting the work of Cezanne and his followers. In response to two articles by MacColl, one reviling Cezanne (Fig.14) and the other praising the work of Charles Jagger, Fry wrote a would-be satirical Letter to the Editor, entitled 'The Sad Case of Mr. MacColl', in which he attacked the 'effective, brutal, catch- penny vulgarity' of Jagger, a wounded veteran who had recently designed a war relief for the British School at Rome (now in the Tate; Fig.I 5).76 This elicited furious letters from Fry's old adversaries at the National Art-Collections Fund, the Earl of Crawford and Sir Robert Witt,77 the former threatening to sever his connexion with the Magazine if there were 'any repetition'. In replying to Witt's objections to the airing of such 'ephemeral' issues in the Magazine - more suited in his view to the daily or weekly press - Tatlock makes a comment which implicitly criticises Fry's own record as Editor: During the very able editorship of Sir Charles Holmes the Burlington was continually fighting for various 'ephemer- al' causes and I was never more convinced of anything al' causes and I was never more convinced of anything than that its very serious loss of prestige later on was in part than that its very serious loss of prestige later on was in part due to a neglect of this often unpleasant duty on the part of the editor. When I was appointed to the editorship I was implored, as I think wisely, by our Directors to take up such subjects once more both in the form of editorials and otherwise. I did so but, I am very well aware, only with partial success.78 It is fascinating that a supposed 'very serious loss of prestige' on the Magazine's part in the post-Holmes years should be associated with the notable absence of editorials in 1912-20. If nowadays those years are rather seen as 'highlights in the journal's history',79 it is largely because of Fry's breadth of vision, which led him to write and commission articles out- side the Magazine's traditional range. In August 1926 Fry wrote to Tatlock after a recent visit to France, suggesting that the critic Waldemar George, editor of L'Amour de l'Art, might be invited to contribute a month- ly letter from Paris,80 and two years later he sent a long letter from Dresden mentioning new pictures with the German dealers, scholars who might be invited to write for the Magazine, and others who should be deterred at all costs.8' Such helpfully meant suggestions, which continued to arrive on Tatlock's desk (for example from Alicante in 1933),82 were perhaps not always entirely welcome. In his obituary note on Fry (Fig.I6) in the Daily Telegraph, Tadock included this interestingly barbed comment: 'He aspired on many occasions to organise art institutions of various kinds. In doing so he always made a brilliant start, but had neither stay- ing power nor the gift of delegating his responsibility to the right people. As a friend - or rather fellow believer - he almost embarrassed one with his kindnesses.'83 There was some truth in this criticism, and it is surely just as well, for example, that the offer of the National Gallery Directorship had come too late inJanuary 19o6 for Fry to be able to accept it: he was temperamentally a part-timer. But, although some of the embarrassment Tatlock speaks of must have derived from Fry's over-enthusiastic interventions into the Burl- ington's affairs, he could hardly be accused in the Magazine's case of lacking 'staying power', having laboured on its behalf with extraordinary dedication for over thirty years. The appointment of Herbert Read (Fig.17) as Editor in 1933 - a brilliant choice, which decisively transformed the Magazine's intellectual fortunes - was evidently not this time due to Fry. He accepted the 'general consensus' that Read was 'the best man', despite 'great distaste for his writ- ings and general weltanschauung'.84 What he failed to foresee was that it was not only Read's (in Fry's words) 'wide gen- eral interests and all-round curiosity' that made him the ideal editor at this point in the Magazine's history, but also his rigorous scholarly standards and his welcoming into the Burlington's pages of the emigre scholars who sought refuge in Britain in the 193 30s.85 Although Read's editorship was relatively brief (1933-39), and in terms of his own personal interests in modern art extraordinarily self-effacing, it was critical to the Magazine's subsequent fortunes. Like Fry, he remained devoted to the Burlington after he left, serving as Chairman of the Editorial Board until his death in 1968, and providing constant support and sagacious advice. It has been the Burlington's great good fortune that it has attracted the lifelong loyalty of such outstanding figures of the twentieth century as these. 76 The sequence is complicated. It begins with a colour frontispiece of a Cezanne bathers sketch, La lutte d'amour (here Fig.14), then in the G.F. Reber collection (THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE 39 (December 1921), p.252). There then follow: D.S. MacColl and R.R. Tatlock: 'Cezanne's Sketch, \"Landscape and Bac- chanales\"', ibid. 40 (January 1922), PP-42-43; D.S. MacColl: 'Two of the Young', ibid.

Tatlock, 15th March and 3oth March 1922, and from Sir Robert Witt to the same, I Ith April 1922, replies from Tatlock, i7th March and 27th March 1922 (The Burlington Magazine archives). For animosity between these men and Fry at the National Art- Collections Fund, see Sutton, p.217, letter to Mary Berenson, 9th January 1904: 'Balcarres has by now got up a pretty strong hatred of me over this National Art- Collections Fund'; and ibid., pp.60oo-o, letter to Lady Fry of 5th April 1927, com- plaining that Witt had suppressed favourable reaction to a lecture for the Fund on the occasion of the great Flemish exhibition, and had failed to mention Fry's r61e in founding the Fund when introducing him. 78 Letter from Tatlock to Sir Robert Witt, 27th March 1922 (The Burlington Magazine archives). Tatlock's slightly woolly editorials lacked the combination of thunder and incisiveness to which Holmes and Fry aspired. 79 Nicolson, op. cit. (note 3), p.I82, applies this phrase to the periods of Fry's and Herbert Read's editorships, as well as to the 1950s. 8so Letter from Fry to Tatlock, 6th August 1926 (The Burlington Magazine archives). The monthly letter did not eventuate. Writing to Helen Anrep on 28th April 1925 (Sutton, p.566), Fry had described George as 'the vulgar loud-voiced but not unintelligent Waldemar-George'. Fry's celebrated essay on Cezanne's development first appeared in L'Amour de l'Art (December 1926). 81 Letter from Fry to Tatlock from Dresden, 3rd June 1928 (The Burlington Magazine archives). 82 Letter from Fry to Tatlock from Alicante, 26th March 1933, recommending Don Antonio Mendes y Casal of the Museo Nacional, Madrid (The Burlington Magazine archives). 83 R.R.

       "  Holmes, Fry, Jaccaci and the 'Art in America' section of The Burlington Magazine, 19o5-10o by FLAMINIA GENNARI SANTORI by FLAMINIA GENNARI SANTORI IN NOVEMBER 1903, August F. Jaccaci (Fig.I8), an IN NOVEMBER 1903, August F. Jaccaci (Fig.I8), an American editor who was then engaged in preparing a fifteen-volume series on private collections of paintings in the United States, instructed his agent in Europe about the attitude he should adopt when approaching the editors of the newly founded BURLINGTON MAGAZINE: 'try to impress [them] as an equal', he wrote, 'not as an amateur or collec- tor in search of information.\" A few years later Jaccaci became the editor of the 'Art in America' section of the Magazine, a short-lived initiative which ran from 1905 to 1910. However, the relationship between Charles Holmes and Roger Fry, successive editors of the Burlington on the one hand, and on the other Frank Jewett Mather Jr and Jaccaci, editors of the Magazine's 'Art in America' section, was never quite one between equals, based as it was on differing views of the section's scope and purpose, which ultimately resulted in the project's demise. The story of the American section of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE is one of unbalanced expectations: those of Fry and Holmes about the American reception of the journal and those of Mather and Jaccaci about European curiosity concerning the growth of interest in the fine arts in America. In the five years of its life, the 'Art in America' section was the site of editorial experiments and attempts to include articles geared to a potential American readership whose likely composition and interests were as yet un- known. While Fry and Holmes were editing an art maga- zine which, although newly established and still finding its way, belonged to some extent to a defined field of scholar- ly periodical publishing, the American editors' frame of reference was a genre of cultural journalism with a distinc- tive social perspective well established in the United States. Jaccaci, a travel writer of obscure origin, began his American career as art editor of the weekly McClure's Magazine, the most successful periodical in the United States at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth cen- turies.\" In 1903 he conceived Noteworthy Paintings in American Private Collections (Fig.19), intended as a lavishly produced fifteen-volume series in which European experts - Fry and Holmes among them - would comment on and assess the artistic value of old-master and modern paintings owned by Americans. The series was addressed to collec- tors - millionaires, it was hoped - and Jaccaci planned to 18. August F. Jaccaci. c. I9Io. (Photograph from The Bookman.

Only the first vol- ume was eventually published, and the enterprise ended in a monumental failure.3 But in 1904 this disaster was still in the future, and Jaccaci was a respected figure in the Burlington's editorial office. Knowing the projected profits Jaccaci expected from his volumes, Fry and Holmes understandably hoped that an American diffusion of the Burlington sustained by Jaccaci would be of great advantage to the journal. Jaccaci, for his part, had his own reasons for wanting the Magazine to be a success in America. With Noteworthy Paintings he sought not only to celebrate American collecting, but also to pro- mote professional expertise, and he came to share Fry's opinion that, if widely distributed, THE BURLINGTON MAG- AZINE could have a positive influence on the American art market, setting criteria of 'decency' for the activities of dealers and standards of quality for acquisitions made by public and private collectors. Fry had met Jaccaci in January 19o5 when he went to New York for the first time. The purpose of the trip was to raise money for the financially stricken Burlington and I would like to thank Caroline Elam for her comments and suggestions in the writing of this article. A.F.

Unlike other influential publications, however, which centred the development of an American art world on the activity of private collectors, the Nation maintained that the arts flourished only within the scope of well-managed insti- tutions. Mather was the most articulate voice propounding this view, and was able to develop around the phenome- non of American collecting of European art a comprehen- sive interpretative frame for the cultural relationship between Europe and the United States. 4 R.

Visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, Florentine school, fifteenth century. (Jarves collection, Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven). Mather edited the 'Art in America' section of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE from June 1905, when the first instalment appeared, to December 1906, when he left for Florence, where he lived in Berenson's orbit until I9Io.I\" During Mather's tenure the section reflected the Nation's institutional perspective, devoting great attention to the development of the Metropolitan Museum, the new plans for the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (Fig.20), the discus- sions over the need for a national gallery in Washington and the creation of a department of fine arts and art history at Columbia University.\"12 The perspective of the section was established in an arti- cle of September 1905 on the arrival of Sir Purdon Clarke - formerly director of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London - as director of the Metropolitan Museum. 'The cognoscenti of New York are looking forward to the administration of Sir C. Purdon Clarke in the Metropolitan Museum, much as the Israelitish brickmakers in Egypt may have yearned for a Moses', was Mather's opening salvo.'3 In December 1904, just after J. Pierpont Morgan had become president of the Metropolitan Museum, Mather and William Rankin, a professor at Wellesley College who had a special interest in Italian primitives, had published two articles in the New York Evening Post exposing the fanciful attributions to be found in the Museum's catalogues.'4 Clarke, who turned out in the event to be very ineffective, was hired as director by Morgan and was in charge until 1909. '5 In his article in the Burlington, Mather expressed the wish that Clarke would not only reorganise the Metropolitan collections, but that he would also be able to influence the museums that were being founded 'with mushroom-like rapidity' elsewhere in the United States.I6 Mather here advocated the diffusion of professional expert- ise in every American museum, even if he admitted that 'imposing severe standards of connoisseurship upon a peo- ple resentful of any sort of superiority, and inclined to ques- tion all pretensions of authority' was going to be difficult. The question of what a museum should do for its pub- lic, and what it meant for it to be 'popular', in particular an American context, provided perhaps the most interest- ing focus of debate in the American art world at that time. The debate crystallised around the project for the new building of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Some of the museum curators proposed a radical change in the exhibit- ing criteria, advocating a highly selective display of works of art based on 'aesthetic' principles. This choice meant dis- posing of the large collections of casts owned by the muse- um, which had been until then one of the cornerstones of museum education, and dividing the collections between primary displays and study holdings. The curatorial board split over the issue, those who advocated a selective display, among whom was Matthew Prichard, prevailing over those who wanted to maintain the traditional display, Edward Robinson among them. Eventually Robinson became assistant director and from I909 director of the Metro- politan Museum.'7 Mather was a strong advocate of the plan for the new Boston Museum primarily because, as he wrote, 'the essence of the plan is the duty of the instructed to choose for the uninstructed'.I' The so-called 'Boston criteria' gave more freedom to experts and curators to devise new ways of conveying to the public the value of works of art, while it defined the professional challenge for a museum curator: to be popular while maintaining the connoisseur's stan- dards.

In 1906, when Roger Fry was curator of paintings for the Metropolitan Museum, the American section closely followed his acquisitions and the new display he was arranging in the museum following aesthetic rather than historical criteria.20 Fry himself wrote about the paintings he acquired for the Metropolitan.2I But during his tenure of the section, Mather also sought to show that in the United States there existed unknown old masters as well as experts able to study them. One of the latter, probably the only one active in the United States at the time, was William Rankin, who a few years before had published an article on the Italian primitives in the Jarves collection at Yale University.22 Between 1906 and 1907 Rankin, sometimes with Mather's collaboration, wrote a series of six articles on 'Cassone Fronts in American collections' (Fig.21).23 They revealed to Burlington readers many previously unpub- lished objects and provided a kind of catalogue of a specif- ic trend in early American collecting. Furthermore, they helped to publicise the Jarves and Bryan collections (at Yale University and the New York Historical Society respec- tively), assembled in the mid-nineteenth century, which were still virtually unknown. As a matter of fact, in the first years of the twentieth century, it was the journal Rassegna d'Arte rather than THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE that published the first accounts of Italian paintings in American collections. This monthly, published in Milan and exclusively devoted to Italian art, was directed by Guido Cagnola, a connoisseur and collec- tor and close friend of Bernard Berenson.24 Less ambitious than the Burlington and more focused on research, discov- 19 'The Purpose and Policy of National Museums', ibid., pp.3-6. 20 News regarding the Metropolitan Museum was published in THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE 7 (une 1905), p.246; (September 1905), p.485; 8 (March 1906), pp.440-43; 9 (April 1906), p.673; (une 1906), pp.210-13; (uly 1906), p.292.

       "  THE 'ART IN AMERICA' SECTION OF THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE eries and conservation of Italian art in Italy, Rassegna d'Arte was, however, a publication which attracted several inter- national contributors, among them Roger Fry. Presumably through Berenson's intercession, Mary Berenson, Frederick Mason Perkins and William Rankin published articles on Italian paintings in American collections there, as early as 1904 and 19o5.25 As an art historian Rankin was more confident than Mather, who had no specific training in the subject, although he was able to mimic the Burlington style. In although he was able to mimic the Burlington style. In 19o6 Mather published a jaunty round-up of recent acqui- 19o6 Mather published a jaunty round-up of recent acqui- sitions in the John G. Johnson collection, but some of his attributions and datings were immediately challenged by Herbert Home and Charles Ricketts. Mather replied defensively invoking other authorities, thus revealing that he was unable to defend an attribution on the basis of his own independent analysis.26 In addition to Mather's and Rankin's articles, the 'Art in America' section published contributions on a variety of topics miscellaneous enough to suggest that no one, either in London or New York, had carefiully thought through who might comprise the section's readership. If the devel- opment of the collecting of Japanese art by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, surveyed in a long and detailed arti- cle, was the major and most innovative American contri- bution to international connoisseurship at the time, it is unclear how many people would have been interested in the generic and rhetorical pieces on 'Plans for a union of artists in New York' or in 'A project for the advancement of architecture', let alone the articles singing the praises of midwestern millionaires who deposited 'treasures' in their local public libraries.27 At the beginning of 1907, when August Jaccaci finally took up the editorship of the section, the Magazine's American pages began to be more coherent. Jaccaci had a clearer vision of what the section should be like, while Holmes and Fry supervised the articles more closely. Furthermore, the pace of American collecting was acceler- ating, with acquisitions of increasing quality. The purchase in 1907 of the Rodolphe Kann collection by Joseph Duveen, in association with Ren6 Gimpel and Nathan Wildenstein, marked a change of scale in American col- lecting while it defined a new dynamic centred on major art dealers, principally Duveen and Knoedler who, with the collaboration of their London counterparts, were able to secure for their American clients exceptional old-master paintings of recognised fame: the Rodolphe and Maurice 23. Clelia Cattaneo, by Anthony Van Dyck. 1623. 122.2 by 84.1 cm. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, Widener Collection). Kann collections and the so-called Cattaneo Van Dycks were typical examples of this new pattern (Fig.23).28 While Fry, Holmes and Jaccaci all believed that it was a feasible task to create an American market for THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, the distributors never made any profit out of the American sale of the journal: between 1905 and 191o three different firms took on the assignment, all giving up after a few months. The first was Robert Grier Cooke for whom Jaccaci, although not editor at the time, acted as mediator with the London editors.29 By November 1907 Grier had had little success and he came to the con- clusion, as he wrote to the London editors, that 'there is no money to be made from the handling in America of the London 1987, passim; C.

       "  THE 'ART IN AMERICA' SECTION OF THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE Burlington Magazine'.3o After unfruitful negotiations with McClure's and Co., it was the turn of Moffat, Yard and Co. They were well aware that no profits were to be expected, especially as the English publishers were not going to contribute to the expenses, but they undertook the task anyway, 'simply for the prestige and advantage of the connection', and in exchange for one page of adver- tisement in the British issue of the Magazine.3' In order to present the task as a rosy prospect to Moffat, Yard and Co., Fry replied that things could not fail to go better in the future, since the distribution had so far been unprofessionally managed; somewhat optimistically he unprofessionally managed; somewhat optimistically he emphasised that an association with the Burlington repre- emphasised that an association with the Burlington repre- sented a long-term investment for the American publish- ers.32 Fry was attempting to market prestige and cultural distinction, but an American demand for these proved elu- sive to identify and exploit. It was on the same supposed demand that Jaccaci had built the monumental enterprise of Noteworthy Paintings. The correspondence between Jaccaci, Fry and Holmes reveals their attempts to capture and create that demand, as well as the collision between the Burlington's aims - the promotion of innovative research in art history and connoisseurship - and Jaccaci's (and Mather's) project - the promotion among the American public of a familiarity with the inner workings of the art world and with new 'trends' in taste and connoisseurship, as a means to participating in a ritual of social and cultural distinction. In December 1907 Moffat, Yard and Co. signed a con- tract with THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE for one year: the price of a subscription was fixed at eight dollars and the company would retain fifty per cent of each advertisement contract they secured.33 Less than a year later Holmes was ready to break the contract: in the last eighteen months they had received no revenues from the United States.34 In 1909 the Burlington finally resolved to change distributor and hired an agent rather than a publisher, who fared slightly better.35 Jaccaci was full of suggestions for improving the Magazine's profile and distribution, and he exploited the meagre sales as leverage to push for a change of strategy. In order to obtain advertisements for the American section, Holmes and Jaccaci discussed the possibility of publishing articles that could 'appeal to all sorts of advertisers', and Jaccaci suggested the treatment of 'furniture, tapestries, sil- ver etc...'.36 Well equipped with the editorial experience he had gained during the preparation of Noteworthy Paintings, Jaccaci had no shortage of ideas for the section. 24.

       "  THE 'ART IN AMERICA' SECTION OF THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE Paintings - to assemble a pool of writers, possibly experts, who could be employed on a variety of subjects. In other words, he started from the writers rather than from the objects. In order to get subscribers and advertisers, he also suggested that editorials in the main section of the journal should announce series of articles on the most important accessions of the American museums and on 'some of the great art treasures which have found their way into private American collections and which are practically unknown or very little known to the world of art'.42 On the occasion of Morgan's acquisition of a few old-master paintings from the collection of King Leopold of Belgium, Jaccaci suggested to Holmes that he should apply his Noteworthy Paintings formula, and publish several apply his Noteworthy Paintings formula, and publish several essays by different experts on each of the paintings, in order essays by different experts on each of the paintings, in order 'to get the benefit of all the different names'.43 He urged Holmes 'to draw upon all big names in Europe' because, he maintained, 'what is essential to the success of the Magazine, what it will put in an impregnable position, is the authority from its contributors'. Jaccaci, who was at the time marketing his book, had an obsession with names of 'world wide reputation' which, he believed, would ensure the success of Noteworthy Paintings. The key for the American success of the Burlington was, he believed, to associate wide publicity with 'scientific' legitimisation. Holmes, who kept a weather eye on the business side of the Magazine, was generally pleased with the way Jaccaci edited the section, with the diversification of the articles and with the stronger emphasis on American art. As a matter of fact, among Jaccaci's commissions it was Siren's articles which most worried the editor: 'it might be unwise to load up our American section with a quantity of Trecento pictures', he wrote, 'since they appeal only to a small section of collectors and are no use for advertisement purposes, indeed rather the reverse. That has been our unfortunate experience here, and an overindulgence in these rare luxuries absolutely ruined the excellent prospects with which the Burlington started under Dell's manage- ment.'44 On the other hand, Holmes was willing to en- tertain a series of articles by Kenyon Cox on American painting (the first one, discussed below, was on Brandegee's portrait of Miss Porter) which he predicted would be 'a welcome change in the American section where cassone fronts have had a good run',45 as long as Cox 'picks only the very best things, and does not deal with them at excessive length'. Holmes was concerned that 'if we deal at length with modern American art we shall certainly be asked why we don't deal with modemrn European art on the same scale, 25. Young woman holding a medal. Circle of Rembrandt. c.I65o. 65.7 by 58.1 cm. (Cincinnati Art Museum). and for that we really have no space available'46 - a very different view from the one Fry was to adopt when he became editor. For Holmes the American section was a site for experiment. Cox's articles were also well received in America, suggesting that readers there could absorb an art magazine but were less ready for a journal with a primarily connoisseurial perspective.47 On the other hand, Jaccaci was not happy with the way the London management of the Magazine treated the affairs of the American art world, in particular its coverage of acquisitions. He maintained that, in order to get American subscriptions and advertisements, all the major acquisitions in America should be treated in the American pages, rather than in the front section of the Magazine. The American section did indeed regularly include articles on acquisitions: in May 1907 Mather wrote about two portraits recently acquired by P.A.B. Widener, a Lady with a rose, then attrib- uted to Frans Hals, and Ambrogio de Predis's portrait of Bianca Maria Sforza (National Gallery of Art, Washington).48 In September and October 1907 Holmes published a two-part article in the section on landscape 1856-1919, Kent OH 1994. 41 Jaccaci to Holmes, 3oth July 1907, 7th August 1907 (P AAA).

This was the portrait by Robert Brandegee of Miss Sarah Porter (Fig.24), then owned by D. Newton Barney in Farmington CT. Miss Porter had been the principal of the girls' boarding school at Farmington that still bears her name, and at which Brandegee taught. Jaccaci had commissioned an article on this painting from Kenyon Cox because he was convinced that it would help the circulation of the Magazine, and its establishment with- in the 'right' American circles, including alumnae of the school.55 Eventually the portrait was reproduced as only a half-page illustration, and Jaccaci was furious. He com- plained to Holmes: 'We had the chance there to make ourselves extremely popular with a most important set of people all over the country, by giving it a full page and preferably a better thing than an half tone. Most of these proofs would have been framed and would have been a permanent advertisement for the Burlington Magazine.'56 In London, Holmes was a loyal supporter of Jaccaci's interests. THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE was the British sales agent for Noteworthy Paintings, and Holmes acted as a press agent for the volume, registering it at Stationery Hall and endeavouring, with no luck, to find subscribers. Holmes wrote an enthusiastic review of the volume, on which Fry 26. Madonna and Child, by follower of Andrea del Verrocchio. Terracotta, painted and partially gilt, 77.5 by 58.4 cm.

       "  THE 'ART IN AMERICA' SECTION OF THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE therefore did not produce a culture of collecting, such as those Italy and France had generated in the past, or that Germany was producing in the present. If the subsequent generation of American millionaires were to be mobilised by a different 'hobby', the editorial suggested, 'the artistic reputation of America would be in danger of vanishing altogether'.59 As if that were not enough, the author also explicitly stated that the level of art criticism in the United States was incompatible with European standards. According to the Magazine's custom, the author of the editorial should have been Charles Holmes, and in fact its style is perfectly homogeneous with that of previous exam- ples. However, the harsh judgment of American life, where 'the eager pursuit of success by men and of pleasure by women leaves no time for the quiet contemplation which a work of art demands from its possessors', might suggest that Roger Fry, who was at the time ending his turbulent relationship with the Metropolitan Museum, had contri- relationship with the Metropolitan Museum, had contri- buted towards framing the argument.60 buted towards framing the argument.60 When Fry became editor of THE BURLINGTON MAGA- ZINE, Jaccaci found his friend to be a much sterner critic of the contributions commissioned for the section than Holmes had been. The October I909 editorial was split into two parts. In the first Holmes took his leave of his readers, while in the second Fry inaugurated his tenure, presenting a kind of editorial manifesto. He argued that the most important thing that had happened in art history and connoisseurship in the previous ten years had been the enlargement of the field to embrace new territories and traditions other than that of the Italian renaissance. As a consequence, art collecting was becoming more daring and sophisticated, partly, he maintained, thanks to THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE. He also asserted that things were radically changing in modem art and that the first visible result was the disappearance of the 'academy' and of the art it fostered and represented.6' The perspective Fry announced in his first editorial was soon reflected in his attitude towards the 'Art in America' section. In 1910o fewer instalments were published, the last being a very brief obituary notice of the artistJohn La Farge (Jaccaci's collaborator on Noteworthy Paintings, and a one- time contributor to the section), published in December. The first disagreement between Fry and Jaccaci, who were at the time, as their correspondence testifies, close friends, was caused by an article on French impressionist paintings in American collections by Emil Waldmann, the curator of the Kunsthalle in Bremen.62 Interestingly, Fry and Jaccaci had begun to argue about the article months before it was published and, even if Fry found it unworthy of the Burlington, he nonetheless pub- lished it in the April 1910o issue. The crux of the matter was the number of illustrations to be included: Fry wrote to Jaccaci that there could be only very few, because the arti- cle 'was hardly up to the standard of criticism which we always want to maintain'. Furthermore, the author had not included paintings in collections which Fry thought deserved comment for their modern works, such as that of J.G. Johnson.63 Jaccaci replied that he was well aware of the mediocrity of Waldmann's piece but that he considered it as a 'catalogue vehicle' for publishing reproductions of interesting and unknown paintings.64 In fact, Jaccaci had sent ten photographs to illustrate the article, nine of which belonged to him.65 In the final article, which Fry had severely cut and which was little more than a list of French paintings in American and Canadian collections,66 only two illustrations were included, a Sea scene by Monet (unfortu- nately captioned as by Manet) in the Pope collection, and a Tiger by Delacroix in the James Hill collection in New York. Among the photographs of Pope's pictures (which Fry had visited in 1906 and greatly admired)67 were some that had not been reproduced in Noteworthy Paintings, such as a Degas pastel of a girl in a tub, which Waldmann right- ly signalled as one of the most 'unusual' and interesting works by the artist in America.68 Fry pleaded shortage of space as the reason for not publishing more reproductions, but he was presumably anxious not to draw attention to this unworthy article by further embellishing it.69 Reproducing works of art in private collections was a highly problematic aspect of the 'Art in America' section. Photographs were expensive and very difficult to obtain. As a matter of fact, Jaccaci's main professional asset, apart from his contacts and knowledge of the publishing industry, was his ownership of hundreds of photographs of paintings in private hands which he had obtained, and commissioned from photographers, during the preparation of Noteworthy Paintings. Jaccaci lent his photographs to the Burlington, and the 'Notes on some pictures in private American col- lections', published in October 1908, had been illustrated with such prints.7O The author of the article, Willem Martin, who had that year been appointed director of the Mauritshuis in The Hague, discussed a Flemish family group in the Perry Belmont collection in New York which he attributed to Comelis de Vos, a portrait of a man in the Widener collection ascribed to Frans Hals, and a Laughing boy again attributed to Hals, owned by George J. Gould, an attribution that must have made Fry shiver.7' 56 Jaccaci to Holmes, 2nd January 1908 (JP AAA). 57 C.

Masthead of the first issue of Art in America (January 1913). In his letters Fry urged Jaccaci to get hold of more inter- esting images, and to ask collectors to pay for the photo- graphs as was the practice in England. Jaccaci, on the other hand, guaranteed that this was out of the question, and pressed Fry to invest more in reproductions. Jaccaci cited the example of Charles L. Freer. Fry had several times urged Jaccaci to get an article on the Freer collection of Asian art, but Jaccaci replied that Freer did not 'want to help anyone to publish any of his things'.72 The other issue on which Fry and Jaccaci disagreed was, of course, the quality of the contributions themselves. Jaccaci claimed not only that, by American standards, the Burlington did not pay enough, but also that in the United States there were very few good writers: 'the conditions here are such that barring luck - which may provide a rare articulate and willing expert - one can get as a rule the sort of decent repertorial or sub-critical work that men like Cox and Mather provide.'73 Jaccaci was clearly anxious to show Fry that their goals for the 'Art in America' section were essentially the same. However, he strongly supported Mather's attributions, and it was an article submitted by Mather which spelled the end for the American section of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE. Even before then, Fry had infuriated Jaccaci by refusing to publish a contribution which came from New York. March 19Io Jaccaci sent an article on a terracotta Madonna recently acquired by the Metropolitan Museum (Fig.Wilhelm Valentiner, then curator of the department decorative arts there, had labelled it as school of Verrocchio for 'reasons of museum policy' but, according to Jaccaci, believed that it was by the master himself.74 The assistant curator at the Metropolitan Museum, Joseph Breck, mitted an article on the Madonna, advancing the attribu- tion to Verrocchio, which seemed 'preposterous' to Fry.Jaccaci replied that Mather, Valentiner and he himself sidered the Madonna to be a Verrocchio, and that 'after 72 Jaccaci to Fry, 27th September 19Io (JP AAA). 73 Jaccaci to Fry, 4th August 19Io (JP AAA). 74 Jaccaci to Fry, I4th April I910 (JP AAA).

       "  THE 'ART IN AMERICA' SECTION OF THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE Verrocchio is not a mathematical or demonstrative propo- sition especially if judged from a photograph'. He added that 'Mather especially made a close and long study of the work and feels strongly about it being a Verrocchio, an early one'.76 Unmoved by Mather's feelings in the matter, Fry did not publish the article on the Madonna. A few months later he did something even more radical to discourage the American critic from writing for the Burlington. At the end of May, Jaccaci informed Fry that Mather was working on an article on the paintings in the collection of the recently deceased Robert Hoe, founder of the Grolier Club and more famous for his passion for books than his discerning eye for pictures.77 Jaccaci expressed enthusiasm for Hoe's paintings, which he presented to Fry as a veritable discov- ery, and a month later he sent Mather's article to London.78 When it was published in the August issue, the editors of the Burlington appended a note to it declaring that they did not support Mather's attributions.79 The article was illus- trated with reproductions of several paintings in the collec- tion, including a Girl holding a medal, which Mather confi- dently gave to Rembrandt (Fig.25), and a portrait of a man dently gave to Rembrandt (Fig.25), and a portrait of a man holding a musical score which he attributed to Chardin.80 holding a musical score which he attributed to Chardin.80 In a long letter to Fry, Jaccaci asked for guidance rather than censorship or, worse, declared disagreement. He defended his, Mather's and Valentiner's judgment, and claimed that recognition should be given to their American perspective on works by Verrocchio (referring to the earli- er disagreement) and Chardin. He also suggested to Fry that the 'Art in America' section should be eliminated altogeth- er if the relationship between London and New York were to be conducted on those terms.8' Fry justified himself by stating he had 'abundant evidence over here that people on first reading the last American article [Mather's on the Hoe paintings] were shocked at the attributions and were only reassured on consulting our editorial note'.8, Then, in the October issue, he published a letter from Valentiner which sustained Mather's attributions, although he refused both Mather's and Jaccaci's letters on the subject.83 This incident marked the end of the 'Art in America' section and ofJaccaci's and Fry's friendship. In one of the last letters of their correspondence, Jaccaci wrote that as 'we are all fighting and striving in the same cause (some as chieftains, others as soldiers) we clearly owe to one anoth- er not to weaken our cause by publicly pitching into any of our comrades for the slips we think they are making and they often make . . .. We are all of us on the firing line so to speak, and what matters above all to the world and the cause, is that we should not treat one another in such a way so as to impair their usefulness to the cause.'84 The diffusion of standards of criticism was the mission that Fry appointed for himself while he was in the United States and Jaccaci enthusiastically embraced it. What the story of the American section probably shows is that the notion of 'standards' and their efficacy depended much more on the dynamics of diffusion and reception of a cultural project than Holmes, Fry and Jaccaci were willing to admit. In 1912 Valentiner, with the financial support of Joseph Duveen and, once again, the collaboration ofJaccaci, con- ceived Art in America as the first American magazine devot- ed to European works of art in American collections. This was not an initiative which foundered after a few years: under the same title, the magazine still flourishes today, though in a very different guise. The editorial statement in the first issue specified that the journal was 'not intended solely for students, but proposes to combine accuracy of knowledge with a due regard for popular interest in the choice of material'.85 The prospectus, which Valentiner sent to Jaccaci, declared that 'there is no reason why an art magazine, similar to the Burlington Magazine, the Gazette des Beaux-Arts and corresponding German periodicals, should not prosper in this country'.86 When one looks at the first issues, it becomes abundantly clear that this slim quarterly publication took not only its title but also its range of contents from the 'Art in America' section of the Burl- ington. The very first number (Figs.27 and 28) contained articles not only by Mather, by Valentiner and by Breck, the author whom Fry had rejected, but also by Berenson and Bode, whom it had become increasingly hard to per- suade to contribute to THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE.87 not mention the terracotta Madonna, probably because he wanted to save the 'discovery' for the Burlington (J.

PRESS OPINIONS ON THE FIRST NUMBER THE TIMES \" The remnant in England who take an authentic interest in m. Itters of art, apart from considerations of fashion and commerce, have long felt it to be an imputation on their country that it should maintain n periodical which dealt with artistic subjects in the spirit of ' high seriousness,' and with the competence shown by the best foreign publications of the kind. Art magazines we have indeed in plenty, intelligently and successfully conducted, but their standard is quite different. . . . The Burlington Magazine (th Savile Publishing Company), the first number of which appears this week, is expressly designed to take away this reproach from among us, and we wish it success. It leads off well and is got up with distinguished care and taste. . . . The price of this luxurious magazine, we may add, is half-a-crown, though a special limited edition, printed on hand-made paper, with the illustrations on India paper, Japanese vellum, &c., and with certain extra plates, may be had for an annual subscription of ten guineis. ... In its character and ambitions, and, judging from this first number, in its achievements, this publica- tion differs totally from anything that has ever yet been attempted.\" THE ATHENAEUM \" The first number of this new periodical promises well. It certainly approximates more nearly to what an art journal should be than anything we have yet had in this country. . . .. We have, in The Burlington Magazine, together with a certain amount of fashionable dilettantism and gossip about curiosities, a large propor- tion of really valuable contributions to the history of art. . . . If . the standard set by the articles we have mentioned can be maintained, the magazine should take a leading place among art journals, not only in England, but also on the Continent.\" THE ACADEMY AND LITERATURE \" The Burlington Magazine, the first number of which lies before us, touches the high-water mark of art journal production in this country. We have been getting used to sumptuosity in this regard, and now it has, in The Burlington, reached a point beyond which wisdom will hardly go.\" THE SATURDAY REVIEW \" The Burlington Magazine has not been heralded by the puff preliminary, and in consequence is as good as we should expect any enterprise which relies so entirely on its merits to be. It is a maga- zine for connoisseurs, and if it maintains the level at which it starts it cannot fail to win its way to the heart of every collector, would-be collector, \"and student of the rare and beautiful in art.\" THE SPEAKER \"The first number of The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs touches a very high standard of excellence, and should the editorial policy of excluding reference-book-made articles be rigorously main- tained in succeeding issues we have little doubt that it will quickly assert its importance in periodical art literature. . . . We be- lieve that there are still a few genuine connoisseurs in the country, and to these The Burlington Magazine will specially appeal. It should also be welcomed by that large class who, standing as it were on the fringe of art knowledge and art appreciation, have as yet received insufficient facilities tor acquiring the .former or developing the latter. To these persons a periodical embracing subjects as wide apart as Italian old masters, French furniture, Persian carpets, and tinder boxes, should be more than merely entertaining, when the articles are the work of acknowledged experts.\" THE LITERARY WORLD \" The first number of The Burlington is interesting from cover to cover, and full of promise for the future. . . . It is evident that no pains have been spared to make this handsome new periodical of interest and value to students and lovers of art, and it is to be hoped that its promoters will receive the heartiest support in their enterprise. A notably successful attempt to supply people of culture with art and literature of a character such as should satisfy the most fastidious taste.\" THE GUARDIAN \" If The Burlington continues as it has begun it is likely to render a real service to art.\" THE PILOT \" Altogether The Burlington is a very sumptuous production.\" THE OBSERVER \" Much has been done in recent years in the way fine-art magazines, but we have seen nothing to equal ture, which is at once chaste in design and scholarly lover of art should miss seeing it, and none who see it it a long life. The articles are fresh, authoritative, and The numerous plates are strikingly good, while paper, general arrangement seem to mark the very acme of perfection a publication.\"[unnumbered]\n",

       "  EDITORIAL ARTICLES u A RETROSPECT OF 1909 & HE beginning of a new HE beginning of a new year and a change of year and a change of editorship in THE BUR- LINGTON MAGAZINE afford a favourable opportunity for a review of the position of the fine arts in the United Kingdom, and that of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE in particular. The past year has been notable in the history of British art for various reasons. Twelve months ago THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE stated that, so far as the arts are concerned, England had no particular cause to be grateful, either to the Prime Minister or to the Leader of the Opposition. It is gratifying that within a short lapse of time this opinion can be safely modified. So far as THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE is concerned, the Prime Minister has vindi- cated himself by the selection of the Editor of the magazine, who had never shrunk from outspoken criticism of the attitude of the Government towards the fine arts, for the directorship of one of our important national galleries. Following on this we have seen the First Commissioner of Works and the Leader of the Opposition, as noted in our editorial article for Novem- ber last, admitting on the same platform the duties of a government in the domain of art. It is satisfactory, at all events, to think that Mr. Lewis Harcourt and Mr. Balfour were not merely using honeyed words and blowing bubbles in political rivalry, but that they were sincere in their wish to help the cause of the fine arts in this country. Mr. Balfour has since de- livered an address to the University of Oxford on the subject of art-criticism, which showed how valuable an ally he might be to THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, if his energies were not perforce diverted into other channels. The purchase of Holbein's Duchess of Milan for the Na- tional Gallery by public subscription was an event of the first importance, not only for the remarkable display of sympa- thetic interest aroused throughout the whole English-speaking race, but also for the ready assistance offered by the Chan- cellor of the Exchequer, in spite of every inducement by stress of circumstances to return a polite and sympathetic negative to the appeal. A further instance of true sympathy with a cause, of which THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE has ever been an ardent and consistent champion, was the inclusion in the Budget of a clause remit- ting to a great extent the death duties on works of art, and thereby mitigating the ever-increasing danger of the export of fine works of art from this country, and the consequent loss of financial and artistic capital. Whatever form the Budget may hereafter take, this step can hardly be retraced by any Government without incurring odium and loss of respect. The opening of the new buildings of the Victoria and Albert Museum by the King and Queen, with the stirring appeal by the King in person to great private collectors to do all within their power to aid the national institutions for the benefit of the people, was in itself a red-letter day in the history of British art. It is, therefore, with satisfaction that THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE can look back on the year 1909. The seed has been sown for an ample harvest, and it will be the duty of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE to aid in the good cause and see that the good seed has not been sown in vain. This object, however, cannot be attained without due support from the friends and well-wishers of the magazine. Although THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE is avowedly and intentionally international THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, No. 82. Vol. XVI.-January, 190o. P 187187\n",
       "  A Retrospect of 19o09 in character, and has good reason to be satisfied with the steady increase in the number of its foreign subscribers, it is still a source of regret that the support given a source of regret that the support given to the magazine by the British public to the magazine by the British public should not show an equally marked growth of interest. Now that THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE has justified its existence, and taken its rank among the authoritative organs of public opinion throughout the world, the Editors feel themselves justified in asking that any reproach of insuffi- cient support in the country of its birth should be speedily and satisfactorily removed. It is noteworthy that during the year 1909 the changes of personnel in the administration of the various national museums and galleries at home and abroad have been exceptionally numerous and important. At home the British Museum has lost the valuable services of Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, G.C.B., who has been replaced by Mr. Frederick G. Kenyon. The Victoria and Albert Museum has gained a new director in Sir Cecil Smith, whose place at the British Museum as Keeper of the Greek and Roman Antiquities has been filled by Mr. Arthur Hamilton Smith. The National Portrait Gallery, as all our readers know, has passed under the control of Prof. C. J. Holmes. All these appoint- ments are of special interest for THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE. On the Continent the changes have been of considerable interest. In Belgium M. Henri Hymans, through advancing years, has retired from his post as conservateur-en-chef of the Bibliothbque Royale at Brussels, where he had served officially for more than halfa century. In Holland, Dr. A. Bredius, than whom no greater authority on Dutch painting exists, has resigned the directorship of the Royal Picture Gallery in the Mauritshuis at The Hague, and has been succeeded in his post by Dr. W. Martin, who is well known to readers of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE. In Germany, the post vacated at the National Gallery in Berlin by Dr. von Tschudi has been filled by the appointment of Dr. Ludwig Justi, while the skill and energy of Dr. von Tschudi have been transferred to Munich. Dr. Max Lehrs has left the Print Cabinet of the Berlin Museum in order to return to his former post at Dresden, and his place at Berlin has been filled by Dr. Max Friedliinder, an appointment of great interest to THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE. At Dresden, besides the return of Dr. Lehrs, the Royal Picture Gallery has lost the valuable services of Dr. Karl Woermann. In Italy various changes in administration have been made, and in such a retrospect of events in 1909 it is important to note the passing of the new law as to works of art in Italy, on which comment has already been made in our columns. The work, which is being carried out throughout the whole of Italy under the guidance of Comm. Corrado Ricci, deserves the atten- tion and interest of all our readers. Finally it may be noted that Mrs. Arthur Strong, one of the leading representatives of her sex in the study of art and archaeology, has been appointed to be assistant.director of the British School at Rome. Trusting in these auguries of progress in the study and practice of the fine arts, THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE can look forward to the coming year in a spirit of hopeful expectation. 188188,\n",

       "  EDITORIAL ARTICLES 'THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE' AND THE WAX BUST h CONTROVERSY ak h CONTROVERSY ak HE Editors regret to HE Editors regret to find that there exists misconception in some quarters as to the atti- tude ofTHE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE towards the controversy about the wax bust in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin. In May, I9o09, the wax bust was first published in THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, by permission of its owner, Mr. Murray Marks, as an extra illustration to an article by Mr. Herbert Cook on the false Leonardo discovery at Milan. The bust had recently become the property of Mr. Marks, who had shown it to the Editor, Prof. C. J. Holmes, at whose wish and on whose responsibility it was included. In con- nexion with the Leonardesque heads treated by Mr. Cook, it naturally seemed of some historical interest, though even then Prof. Holmes was careful to record his impression of its later date. This was prior to the bust being purchased by Dr. Bode, and naturally without any anticipation of the storm which this par- ticular work of art was likely to excite. On the outbreak of this controversy the present Editors were of opinion that, as stated in an editorial article for December, I909, no useful purpose would be attained at that time by discussing the subject in THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE. On the one side was Dr. Wilhelm Bode, for long accepted as a leading authority and expert on art, and the creator of the wonderful Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin, who also had proved himself a good friend and supporter of THE BURLINGTON MAGA- ZINE ; on the other side were certain English gentlemen in whose veracity and good faith the Editors had perfect con- fidence,-a confidence unshaken by any- thing which has been said or published subsequently. Since that article appeared the contro- versy has been considerably aggravated. The Editors have no hesitation in saying that the evidence hitherto adduced on both sides brings to their minds an over- whelming conviction that the wax bust, whatever its artistic merits, is entirely the work of Richard Cockle Lucas. They do not consider that an expression of their private opinion is in any way binding upon the contributors and subscribers to THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, or that the Magazine need thereby be involved in the controversy on one side or the other. The Editors indeed regret that this unhappy controversy should have led to strictures in his own country on Dr. Bode's administration of the Berlin museums. Still more do they regret that in certain German periodicals now before them an attempt should have been made to attribute the attitude of art experts and critics in this country to mere racial animosity between England and Germany. To this suggestion the Editors are in a position to return an emphatic and unqualified negative. The Editors have always considered that national divisions have no place in the study of art, and they must, therefore, decline to publish any further discussion on this question, unless it be of a nature likely to bring the controversy to a decisive conclusion.

       "  EDITORIAL ARTICLES c DR. BODE AND 'THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE' T will be seen trom the T will be seen trom the letter which we publish letter which we publish below that Dr. Wilhelm Bode has requested the directors to remove his name from the Consultative Committee ofTHE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE. To comply with this request has been a matter of deep regret, inasmuch as Dr. Bode had been a true friend to the Maga- zine from its inception, and at a critical period in the Magazine's history had rendered invaluable service wh ich has been recognized on more than one occasion. The intransigeant attitude adopted by Dr. Bode with reference to the wax bust of Flora in the Berlin Museum would seem to render it impossible for him to co-operate in a friendly manner with those who take a more tolerant view of artistic disagreements, and who hold that such disagreement on any particular point of expertise need not, and should not, lead to any breach of friendship. The Editors are resolved to exclude from THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE any matter of a personal nature, or which might seem likely to be a cause of personal offence. In a controversy such as that which has raged round the wax bust of Flora THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE has adopted the only impartial course open to it, by declining to publish any material which did not bear directly on the object under discussion and thereby give some opening for a final decision. The suggestion made by Dr. Bode that the Magazine has taken a personal line against him is unfounded. The Editors have never abated their admiration for Dr. Bode's distinguished career as Director of the Berlin Gallery, nor their gratitude for the services which he in person has rendered to THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE. It is with the authenticity of the bust that art-critics and experts are concerned, whereas Dr. Bode has diverted the con- troversy towards his own personal repu- tation. In this course the Editors decline to follow him. Charlottenburg, den 5 Juli, 1910o. Uhlandstr. 4-5. An die Herausgeber des BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, London.

STHE NEW TURNER GALLERY T is expected that while these pages are at the press the new wing which has been added to the Tate Gallery at Millbank, through the generosity ot the late Sir Joseph Duveen, will be opened to the public. This wing has been specially constructed to contain the pictures and drawings of Turner, and the works which this great painter bequeathed to the nation will be for the first time exhibited as a single collection. It will be remembered that the question of building a Turner Gallery at Millbank was raised originally by a letter from Mr. Lionel Cust to the Editor of 'The Times' in July, I906, at a time when the Government authorities seriously contem- plated utilizing the vacant land at the back of the Tate Gallery for a new Stationery Office. The support given to Mr. Cust's proposals caused the abandon- ment of this scheme, and the Director of the National Gallery was informed by the First Commissioner of Works that if a certain sum of money could be provided from private sources to erect a Turner Gallery, the Government would be pre- pared to find the remainder. Thanks to the efforts of Sir Hugh Gilzean Reid, this sum was within a near distance of being secured, when further need for it was removed by the generous action of Mr. Duveen, who offered to erect a Turner Gallery at his own cost. An allusion to the scheme thus first proposed by Mr. Cust will be found in THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE (1907), Vol. ii, p. 331. In one of our forth- coming numbers we shall give a detailed account of the new arrangements, whereby the genius of Turner will be at last adequately revealed and displayed. cTHE CONTEMPORARY ART SOCIETY E welcome the formation of a society for the acquisition of modern works of art for our National and Provincial Museums. The inadequacy of the administration of the Chantrey Bequest for this purpose needs no further demonstra- tion. Those who know how much is done in French and German Galleries for the encouragement of modern art will recog- nize how far behindhand we are in this respect in England. The founders of the Contemporary Art Society hope to do something to remedy this defect. Their methods will be closely similar to those of the National Art Collections Fund which has done such inestimable service to the nation in the matter of ancient art. They hope to work in harmony and co-operation with that body, but they intend to retain possession of their acquisitions and lend them, as occasion arises, to the National and Provincial galleries, only parting with them when the test of time has deter- mined their proper destination beyond all reasonable doubt 254254,\n",

       "  Letters to the Editors Mr. Cust, so is the composition. Indeed, the two compositions could very well be regarded as compositions could very well be regarded as pendants. I have not the least doubt that the two pendants. I have not the least doubt that the two pictures from Hampton Court, illustrated in Mr. Cust's article [see PLATE B and c], are copies after two other canvases of the same series to which the New York canvas originally belonged. [B] represents Simeon being bound and detained by Joseph, while in [c] we have most likely the death of Jacob (in the background there can be seen a group of Egyptians with the statue of an idol). The New York canvas is of larger propor- tions (671 h. by 561 w.), an exact description of it will be found in the Catalogue of Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum.-Very truly yours, MORTON H. BERNATH. Leipsic, December, 1910. REVIEWS AND NOTES SELECTED EXAMPLES OF INDIAN ART. By Ananda K. Coomaraswamy. DR. COOMARASWAMY has endeavoured by the publication of forty-two reproductions of different periods of Indian art to assist in the slowly- awakening appreciation in this country of the importance of Indian design. As he says, Indian art has for too long been judged from entirely inadequate reproductions in woodcut or litho- graphy of some of the more showy and least interesting examples, so that Indian art is the 'least known' and the least accessible of all Asiatic arts. His plates are admirably reproduced, the sculpture in collotype and the paintings either in collotype or by colour process. His coloured reproductions are strikingly above the average, and one or two of them are of real beauty as works of art. Nevertheless, by comparison with the sculptures, they suffer, I think, from the fact that they belong to the Mogul period when native traditions were dying out and when the imported Persian style was the only one practised. It is quite true that the Indian artists who worked for the Mogul emperors modified very materially the Persian originals, but the modification seems to have been chiefly in the direction of a rather petty realism. The great style of early Indian sculpture depended almost entirely upon the intensity of its religious inspiration ; the art of the Moguls, on the other hand, was essentially a servile art, and if we compare Indian art with other schools of Oriental design we are, I think, forced to the conclusion that the Indian is moved less than others by a pure sense of beauty; his art therefore fails or succeeds almost entirely ac- cording to the intensity and imaginative beauty of the ideas which he seeks to express. In the early sculpture of Java, Ceylon, and one or two Indian centres such as Sarnath and Sanchi, those religious conceptions which the Indians comprehended more profoundly than any other race attain expression in forms of supreme grandeur and dignity. The statue of Kapila in Ceylon (seventh century) is not only as the author says one of the noblest of all Indian sculptures, but would take high rank in the sculpture of any time or country for its superb dignity of gesture and its feeling for scale, which may be tested by the fact that although the figure is actually under life size, the reproduction here given suggests a design of colossal proportions. Another sculpture of consummate beauty is that of a figure of a Tamil saint, probably of the twelfth century, Polonnaruva (Ceylon). It would be impossible in European sculpture to find any figure quite so profoundly expressive of the self- contained dignity of the contemplative life. I have only hinted at a few of the masterpieces contained in this admirable portfolio. Dr. Coomaraswamy will confer a real benefit upon European students if he continues to make known the great masterpieces of Indian art, but we scarcely feel that his work is improved by the inclusion of examples from the praiseworthy, but as yet sentimental, school of modern Indian painters. The more he can give us of the great sculpture of the seventh and eighth centuries, the more we shall welcome his efforts to stimulate the study of Indian art. SIGNOR VIRZI'S PICTURE To the Editors of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE. GENTLEMEN,-I would suggest Torbido as the author of the Virzi ' Raphael Lotto' portrait dis- cussed by Mr. Fry in the December number THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, pp. 137 and 8. Photographic comparison with Torbido's signed portrait in the Brera makes me almost certain of the attribution. Respectfully, DAN FELLOWS PLATT. Englewood, New Jersey.

       "  Netherlandish books of hours, which form part of the Wittert bequest; twenty-five from the one and twelve from the other. The text of both is and twelve from the other. The text of both is in the vernacular, and in a dialect thereof which in the vernacular, and in a dialect thereof which has been identified as belonging to the old dio- cese of Utrecht or thereabouts : theart is Flemish of the Bruges-Ghent school. M. Brassine in his short introduction points out that this raises a couple of pertinent questions: were manu- scripts written at Ghent and Bruges in the dia- lect required by the clients of the local artists, or did those artists simply illuminate manu- scripts which had been written elsewhere? He does not attempt to solve the problem, but thinks the second hypothesis the more probable. Both sets of reproductions are interesting, and we hope that M. Brassine will continue his good work. E. B. LETTERS LEONARDO AND OVID.- SIR,-One of the most striking of the many im- pressive passages in Leonardo's manuscripts, is that in which the description of the old age of Helen :s used to illustrate the remorseless flight of time. The passage occurs in the Codex Atlanticus, fol. 71 recto, a.:-- O tempo, consumatoreo delle cose, e o invi- diosa antichitli, tu distruggi tutte le cose! e con- sumate tutte le cose dai duri denti della vecchiezza, a poco a poco, con lenta morte! Elena, quando si specchiava, vedendo 1? vizze grinze del suo viso, fatte per la vecchiezza, piagne e pensa seco, perchd fu rapita due voltet O teompo consumatore delle cose, e o invidiosa antichitid, per la quale tutte le (cose) sono con- sumate ! It is translated in my edition of \" Leonardo da Vinci's Notebooks \":- ' O Time, thou that consumest all things ! O envious age, thou destroyest all things and devourest all things with the hard teeth of the years, little by little, in slow death ! Helen, when she looke4d in her mirror and saw the withered wrinkles which old age had made in her face, wept, and wondered to herself why ever she had twice been carried away. O Time, thou that consumest all things! O envious age, whereby all things are consumed !\" The passage has, I believe, usually been regarded as Leonardo's own composition, but it is derived from Ovid's \" Metamorphoses,\" so closely as to be in fact a translation. The lines occur in Book XV, 232-236:-- Flet quoque, ut in speculo rugas aspexit aniles Tyndaris, et secum,, cur sit bis rapta, requirit. Tempus edax rerum, tuque, invidiosa vetustas, Omnia destruitis, vitiataque dentibuss aevi Paulatim lenta consumitis omnia morte. This interesting fact was, I think, first revealed by Gerolamo Calvi in the Archivio Storico Lom- bardo, but I owe my knowledge of it to his book, \" I Manoscritti di Leonardo da Vinci dal punto di vista cronologico storico e biografico,\" which has just been published by Zanichelli, of Bologna, and which I should like to recommend to the attention of all students of Leonardo's work as, the most analytical and comprehensive study which has ever appeared of the Leonardo manuscripts from the his- torical and biographical point of view. Yours faithfully, EDWARD MCCURDY. THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE MONOGRAPH ON \" CHINESE ART.\" SiR,-I hope you will give publicity to an apology I feel bound to make for a serious omission which occurred in the volume on \" Chinese Art,\" you have just published. Plate 2, E, of my article on\" jade,\" is given no owner. This piece, as well as Plate 3, B (described as the property of Mr. J. N. Collie), was kindly lent me by one who is known to Europe as a chemist, to your readers, perhaps, as collector, and to the British public (characteristically enough) as a mountaineer. Professor J. N. Collie, F.R.S., LL.D., during whose term of office as President of the Alpine Club the first attempt was made on Mount Everest, is the owner of these two pieces. But there was a more important omission than this mere matter of ownership and honorific titles. It is to Professor Collie that I owe all the scientific information on that interesting and little understood question to which I have given special prominence in the article: I mean those criteria of the age of jade-carvings, which his observations as a chemist and a student of Chinese art have done so much towards establishing. Yours faithfully, W. W. WINKWORTH. \" THE TAPESTRIES OF THE PAINTED CHAMBER.\" SIR,-The subject of the first part of sketch D in Mr. Marillier's interesting article in the January number of the BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, is not \" The Oath of Achilles \" but \" Achilles Consulting the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi.\" Also, though Mr. Marillier was unable to find a counterpart of his sketch A, it exists as one of the four Trojan war tapestries in the cathedral of Zamora. This tapestry was illustrated by my learned friend, M. Gomez- Moreno in a comprehensive paper on this Trojan war group of tapestries printed in Volume IV, No. 6, of Arte Espaftol. Also, Mr. Marillier is mis- taken when he says that: \" Few, if any (of these Trojan war tapestries), have preserved more than fragments of these legends.\" On the contrary, about one-half of the surviving tapestries of this fifteenth-century group have preserved both the French legends at the top and the Latin legends at the bottom, while about one-fourth have preserved either the French or the Latin legends, leaving only one-fourth unlegended.

       "  ROGER FRY T is with deep regret that we have to record this month the sudden death on record this month the sudden death on September 9th, of one so closely associated September 9th, of one so closely associated with the history and conduct of this Mag- azine as Roger Fry. In the note that follows, Sir Charles Holmes describes that connexion in some detail; in the next issue we hope to publish a more personal appreciation which will give some estimate of the artist, the scholar and the critic. For the moment we can only express the sense of our great loss. England has lost her leader in the world of art; this Magazine has lost not only the man who in the past did most to establish it and mould its character, but one who was always ready with his help and advice, and who actually devoted a con- siderable measure of his time to its interests. Much will be written about Fry's achievements in scholar- ship and criticism, but only those who have been associated with him for more than thirty years in the venture represented by this Magazine can realize how closely he was identified with its policy, and how large a place it occupied in his life. Next month the tribute will come from one of his contemporaries; but, to be complete, the tribute should include a note from a younger genera- tion. It is difficult to estimate all we owe to the genius of Roger Fry. In scholarship he has been our model, but as a scholar he has had his equals. It was something more than knowledge that made him such an inspiration to us-some special gift of perception or sensibility which revealed the nature of art to our adolescent minds. He was a man of his time, very wide in the range of his interests, free from prejudice and from all forms of intellectual or academic snobbery, a very cultured intelligence expressing himself with great clarity and eloquence. He appealed particularly to us because he came as the prophet of a new order of things. He introduced the post-Impressionists to this country ; he discovered for us the great genius of C6zanne. He had the rare gift in his writings and lectures of communicating enthusiasm, but this was not due to any emotive quality in his mode of expression, but solely to the logic and the force of his argument. Even in the controversies of art and scholarship he cared most for the pursuit of truth, and was prepared, to use his own words, to \" lay aside all his personal ambitions and hopes, all his prejudices and preconceived ideas, and accept implicitly the arbitrament of objective fact.\" In his volume of essays, Transformations, there is another passage which gives the true image of the place he occupied in his generation and of the services he rendered to the cause of art : Baudelaire compared the great names in art to lighthouses posted along the track of historic time. The simile, as he used it, seizes the imagination and represents a great truth, but it allows of an inter- pretation which the limits of a sonnet form forbade him to develop. He takes the lights of his beacons as much for granted as the sailor does the lights of real lighthouses. But the lighthouses of art do not burn with so fixed and unvarying a lustre. The light they give is always changing insensibly with each generation, now brighter, now dimmer, and often enough growing bright once more. But we sometimes forget that the lights have to be tended or they grow faint and may expire altogether. For them to burn brightly they must be fed by the devotion of some few spirits in each generation. ROGER FRY AND THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE BY SIR CHARLES HOLMES HE services rendered by Fry to THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE have been many and valuable, but since the most im- portant of them all is now become a matter of ancient history it is well that it should not be forgotten. Just thirty-one years have passed since the short-lived enterprise of the Savile Publishing Company collapsed in a ruin which seemed complete. Fry was almost alone in recognizing in that crisis the germ, the chance, of a magazine which should do for English art scholarship' what the Gazette des Beaux Arts and the Repertorium were doing for continental reputation. Our museums and galleries were at a serious dis- advantage in this respect. Our scholars had few opportunities of expressing their views or even of publishing any interesting discovery resulting from their researches. To make this ideal a reality was no light matter. For four months, September to December, 1903, Fry was indefatigable in interviewing creditors, liquidators, solicitors, and, of course, the financial vultures who collect round any such promising carcase. Scheme after scheme was weighed and found wanting ; one particularly dangerous counter- move being defeated only by the self-sacrificing loyalty of D. S. MacColl. And all the while Fry was not only struggling with ill-health at home, but was busy begging his friends to advance the capital required for a fresh start. Mr. Robert Dell mean- while had been working independently to the same end, so that by joining forces at the close of the year K I45 Tri BURLINGTON MAOAZD~1934145\n",
       "  Roger Fry and The Burlington Magazine THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE was free once more. Fry's reputation at this time was based almost wholly upon his critical scholarship. So far as the Italian Primitives were concerned he had no superior Italian Primitives were concerned he had no superior in England; in the case of the French Primitives, he in England; in the case of the French Primitives, he had no equal. The retirement of Sir Edward Poynter from the Directorship of the National Gallery seemed now to offer Fry the chance of action in another field where action was sorely needed. Educated opinion had long been concerned over the assaults of American wealth upon English private collections; the apparent absence of any method or foresight in meeting those inroads had aggravated the general disquiet. But the official wheels moved slowly, and when the Directorship was at length offered to Fry, he had just accepted a rival offer from the Metropolitan Museum of New York. What he might have done at Trafalgar Square may be guessed from his bold stroke in March, 1918, when he persuaded the Treasury, through his friend, Mr. J. M. Keynes, to finance the purchase of works by Ingres, Delacroix, Manet, and others, at the Degas Sale, filling thereby the most notable of all lacunae in our National Collection. The accident which deprived England of Fry's services was, however, a fortunate one for THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE. The process of financial recovery had been steady, but it had also been ex- ceedingly slow. The need for further capital was evident, indeed, pressing, by the time that Fry, having reached America, was able to enlist fresh support from his associates there. Mr. Pierpont Morgan, Mr. John G. Johnson of Philadelphia, and his friend, Mr. J. W. Simpson, with Mr. Henry Walters of Baltimore, completed the good work which Sir Herbert Cook, Lord Plymouth, Lady Herringham, and others in England, had begun, so that the Magazine was at length able to publish (as it has done ever since) without fearing that each new number might prove to be the last. This record of facts will, I trust, dispel the illusion, too commonly held, that Fry was an unpractical, if not an impracticable, visionary. For months he devoted attention which he could ill spare to negotiations of the most trying kind, at the sacrifice of all his natural sympathies, in order that the English might have a reputable art magazine. Time after time, in the same cause, he undertook that supremely distasteful business, begging for money. And for the period of some seven years during which I worked with him, I cannot recall one single moment in which he was anything but per- fectly reasonable as regards the conduct of the Magazine, displaying, indeed, a courage, a tolerance and a foresight which made him an ideal colleague for one more timid and impatient. Of his personal charm I need not speak. I never felt it more strongly than sometimes when I was with him in his studio and he confessed, like a humble art student, how difficult he found it to reconcile his natural straight- forward vision with his aesthetic convictions. But as the virtual founder of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE Fry was troubled by no such internal conflict between sense and intellect. He could put his whole strength into the work, and his epitaph for those who read the magazine to-day might well be that of Sir Christopher Wren. MICHELANGELO'S RONDANINI PIE TA BY CHARLES TOLNAY HE Oxford sketches of the Pietd (Frey 239) [PLATE II, A] are so very different from the Rondanini Pietd in the Sanse- verino-Vimercati Palace in Rome' [PLATES I; II B, c; III] that it is quite comprehensible that one of the most trustworthy experts on Michelangelo should question the con- nexion between the drawings and the marble group.2 In all three sketches the fundamental motive is the same. Mary, who is represented standing, supports the body of Christ, built on Herculean lines, under the arms, and expends the last ounce of her strength in the endeavour to hold up the nerveless mass. In the marble group, on the other hand, the head and torso of Christ are upright and lean against Mary who, in her turn, leans against the Body. The opposing forces between the supporting and sup- ported figures are removed; both appear equally imbued with spiritual life and cling together in love. Even in the Inventory found in Michel- angelo's house, the group is described as \" attacato insieme.\"3 But, in spite of this fundamental differ- ence, the relationship between the Oxford sketches and the Rondanini Pietd cannot be called in question, for the marble group, as we see it to-day, is the result of a remodelling--as Vasari had already indicated.4 1 I wish here to thank Count Sanseverino-Vimercati most warmly for having so kindly given me the opportunity to study and to photo- graph his Piet4. 2 KARL FREY : Die Handzeichnungen Michelangelos. On p. 1 4 we read : \" Ich sehe die Notwendigkeit auf die vorliegenden Skizzen (Scil. Frey 239) die Pietd Rondanini zu beziehen nicht ein. Die Unterschiede sind zu gross.\" Mr. J. C. Robinson was the first to establish the connexion between the Oxford sketches and the marble group in Rome.

       "  THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE AND THE WAR N the outbreak of the Four Years War, N the outbreak of the Four Years War, the following \" Special Notice \" was the following \" Special Notice \" was published in THE BURLINGTON MAGA- ZINE for September 1914 :- \" In face of the present international situation, we must expect that for a time interest in art and the history of art is likely to give place to more violent claims on the attention of the public. We feel it to be none the less of the utmost importance, at such a time, to keep alive those disinterested activities which are the distinguishing mark of civilization. Even though the appeal that art makes is feebler than the more pressing demands of self- preservation, it is more persistent and more endur- ing. While, therefore, the Directors and Editors must look forward to a time of stress for the fortunes of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE they have no intention whatever of allowing it to lapse. But in order to husband their resources they may feel it necessary to make certain reductions in the cost of production of the Magazine. They hope that their many friends and supporters will acquiesce in the wisdom of this course and will also keep alive the standard of serious and independent criticism for which we may fairly claim that THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE has constantly striven.\" The above notice-every phrase of which, to those who know his style, unmistakably reveals the author- ship of Roger Fry, at the time one of our two joint editors-remains entirely applicable to the policy which has been followed by those responsible for the directing of this Magazine ever since September 1939. And it is perhaps of advantage, that those principles should be re-affirmed at a moment like the present, so heavily fraught with destiny for the survival of all the ideals of Western Civilization. We believe, then, that THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE has its part to play in the good fight which Great Britain and her Empire are fighting: the fight for the cause which ultimately is bound to prevail, at whatever sacrifice, against the forces of barbarism. Internationalism in its true and proper sense has ever been a main plank in the platform of this journal, and normally it has been reflected with particular clearness in the composition of our circle of contributors. Under present circumstances, the position in this respect is inevitably much altered: but we are determined to see to it that there shall be no change either in our standard of scholarship or the breadth of our range of interests. For the benefit of our readers abroad, we should perhaps explain that the reduction in the number of our pages is due to the existing regulations regarding the restriction of paper supply, restrictions which apply indiscriminately to all periodicals published in Great Britain. The possibilities of destruction inheient in the methods of present-day warfare are tragically immense. It is no insignificant part of the debt owed by the world to the defenders of England, that up to the moment of writing the casualties in the realm of art-though grievous and deeply re- grettable-should yet, comparatively speaking, have been so unimportant. A word of commendation is due in this connection to the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings for its watchfulness and resource in dealing with a problem of great complication: notably the scheme of practical action, set out in Lord Esher's and Mrs. Esdaile's letter to the Times of August 13th, deserves the support of all lovers of art. The measures of pro- tection adopted at an early stage of the present emergency for the more valuable contents of the museums and art galleries all over the country, have by now fully proved their appositeness; but while we can derive some comfort from the fact that so many irreplaceable works of art have been removed to localities which, it is to be hoped, may prove less vulnerable than their ordinary habitats, yet the times through which we are passing must inevitably be full of deep anxiety both for art lovers in general and more especially, of course, for the Nation's official guardians of her art treasures. War, however, as shown by repeated experience, does not bring solely destruction : it is also, to some extent, productive of discoveries. If, as yet, Great Britain has not yielded anything comparable to certain of the finds made in France during the last war, nevertheless from all parts of the country there are coming reports of discoveries, directly or indirectly the result of war activities. Now it is a report of a fragment of a Saxon Cross found near Bath; now of a seventeenth-century brass-inlaid gunner's tool come to light at Rickmansworth; now of a pai ticularly fine Castor ware Roman vase found in East Anglia-in short, there are scarcely any limitations to the possibilities which exist in this respect. We shall hope, as opportunity offers, to deal with some of the more significant items of gain and loss during the months which lie ahead: and we confidently appeal to our friends for their continued support in an emergency whose impli- cations, as regards the cause of art, stand in no need of emphasis. Until the general situation is modified, one of our Directors, Professor Tancred Borenius, has agreed to act as Honorary Editor of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, our previous valued Editor, Mr. A. C. Sewter having recently taken up a post at the Barker Institute of Fine Art at Birmingham University. THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, No. 451, Vol. lxxvii, October 1940 G 105105,\n",

       "  THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE NUMBER 538 \" VOLUME XC - - ,JANUARY 1948 Editorial Editorial THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE HEEDLESS of nearly half a century of changing fashions, awake, but hostile, to the glitter of successive seasons, THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE has emerged demurely at monthly intervals from the printing press, arrayed in the same starched garments. If we place side by side the issues for March 1903 and for December 1947, we may notice a new stitch here and there, perhaps a tuck or two in the sleeves - but scarcely any modification of layout or of wording on the cover can be detected. It is true that the earlier volume in its enviable cor- pulence could to-day provide ample material for five issues, and that the price has risen in inverse proportion to the num- ber of pages. But the buff background has remained constant throughout the decades. And 537 times the same phrase has proclaimed the magazine's destination: - 'for connoisseurs', we used to read, 'illustrated and published monthly'. We can only assume that at one time the tortuous squiggles captivated the sensitive eye, and that the no less tortuous sub-title ex- pressed succinctly what the founders intended. But to-day the decoration and the wording have lost what meaning they may once have held. The letter-headings have been left to slide into the category of period pieces; and the word 'connoisseur' now conjures up a picture of an elderly gentleman in white bow tie and trim Imperial, familiar, if not in life, at any rate in the pages of Aldous Huxley. He has dined well. In one hand he holds an expensive cigar, in the other a magnifying- glass through which he peers knowingly at the contours of an oriental vase. As for the expression 'illustrated and published monthly', it has forced itself so long and so persistently on our attention that now we can scarcely recognise its senselessness. Our excuse for acquiring a new outfit of clothes is to be rid once and for all of that whiff of mustiness and camphor balls which filled our nostrils as we opened the wardrobe door. No one can reasonably claim that by sacrificing the old cover and the old layout, we have sacrificed elegance or lu- cidity. But many readers who nurse an understandable affec- tion for THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE as it used to be, may mourn the disappearance of so much decent ugliness. Let us hasten to reassure our conservative critics, with whom we ourselves feel much in sympathy, that the traditions of the Magazine are too persistent for us to wish, or be able, to depart radically from them. For this reason Mr Vivian Ridler, who is responsible for the present design, has been at pains to steer clear of voguishness, preferring to preserve some of the restraint and austerity of the old within the framework of the new. He has resisted the temptation of flamboyant gesture in the lettering, of too much crowding on the page; and but for the dark colour and for one distant note of fantasy in the medallion, some casual catch sight of this volume lying on a conscious of any change. We trust that by making these cautious succeeded in bringing the form of the harmony with its contents. The latter do the same revision. For learning, when charged asm, is timeless; only the form in which may lose something of its freshness with not, therefore, be supposed that the modern rower margins imply a corresponding revolution policy. Although we may wish to introduce warmth and liveliness where we believe at present lacking, our first concern must those standards of erudition on which the Magazine is founded. Although we intend casional articles on modern art - and by art that is truly alive, not pale competent styles - we have no intention of abandoning interested, inquisitive and humble spectators Although we do not disdain to publish nature of aesthetic experience, if ever scholars to extract substance from so nebulous pathies must still lie primarily in the direction analyses of past events. And however much the reassessment of the Great Masters in porary thought, our most urgent message as that expressed in the Editorial for April history of artistic development is no mere the points of scholarship - minute as they seem - which are essential to its elucidation, must be greatly concerned. Those who resent of such points we cannot satisfy.' Into our new bottle we have tried to mature wine of scholarship to which the Editorial was referring.

       "  THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE NUMBER 763 VOLUME CVIII ' OCTOBER I966 Editorial Editorial ROGER FRY AND THE BURLINGTON ROGER FRY AND THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE ROGER FRY was born Ioo years ago this year. He was, with Berenson, the most distinguished scholar to have been inti- mately associated with this Journal in its early, struggling days, and remained an active supporter and regular contri- butor until the year of his death (I934). One would not gather from Virginia Woolf's beautiful biography of him that THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE meant anything more to him than just one of innumerable toys to play with. It was much closer to his heart than this. The point was well brought out in an anonymous obituary of him in the Oct- ober 1934 issue: 'Much will be written about Fry's achieve- ments in scholarship and criticism, but only those who have been intimately associated with him for more than thirty years in the venture represented by this magazine can realize how closely he was identified with its policy, and how large a place it occupied in his life.' Though all the information available has already been published about his connexion with the Journal in earlier Burlington editorials, in memoirs and in studies devoted to Fry, it would not be correct for us to pass over his centenary in silence. Fry played an active part in the Journal's foundation and, with other leading international scholars, served on the Consultative Committee from the first issue (March 1903) onwards. As is well known the Journal suffered a serious financial setback within a few months of its launching. Fry held endless discussions with Charles Holmes and Berenson in an effort to find ways of reviving it, and during the autumn of the first year tramped around London with a begging bowl - in Holmes's words: 'no rebuff would shake his deter- mination to carry the matter through'. The money was raised and for a year or so the Journal limped on, but in November 1904 there was only sufficient capital left to keep it going for another few issues, and it was then, on a tour of the United States, that Fry saved THE BURLINGTON MAGA- ZINE, persuading the richest and most prominent Ameri- can collectors to take up shares sufficient to carry it through till 1909 when for the first time the balance sheet showed a small profit. It seems odd to write of Fry as a business man, but he did not conform to the popular conception of the aes- thete; his feet were too firm on the ground. (Mrs Woolf(p.124) hints at a possible explanation, that he had inherited his business ability 'perhaps from some old Eliot or Fry who in bygone days had made a fortune by chocolate-making or shipping'.) He became editor of the Journal with Lionel Cust in 1909. They were joined in 1913 by More Adey, the devoted friend of Oscar Wilde, to form a triple editorship. By 1919 Adey was sole editor, but this did not mean that Fry's active interest in the Journal then ceased: this was his child and he was not going to miss watching it grow up. From his first contributions, which begin in the year of the Journal's foundation, it is obvious where his chief interests lie: in French primitives and the Italian Trecento and Quattrocento. ('You see', he writes to his father, 'whatever success I have had has been the result of my Italian studies, not only in lecturing and writing, but in painting. It is there that I find the real source of all my ideas and there I must go often to get them.') Until 1907 he seldom ventured in these pages beyond Titian. But his taste and his experience were fast widening, and the time had come to spread his wings. Between 1908 and 19 11 a series of articles and notes appeared in THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE under his signature on Albert P. Ryder, Catalan painting, medieval illuminated manuscripts, early English portraiture, Mohammedan art, Japanese painting, modernj ewellery, Rogier van der Weyden, Chinese porcelain ... and until the end no image fashioned by man was too alien to be submitted to his passionate and cool scrutiny. The Journal in its early years had not been famous as a champion of contemporary painting, but suddenly, in March 19o8, it rushed into the breach with a 'Letter to the Editor' from Roger Fry protesting against the lack of attention paid by THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE to the latest and most exciting developments in French art. In this letter he speaks of Czanne and Gauguin reacting against the 'anarchic licence of Impressionism': 'There is no need for me to praise Cezanne - his position is already assured - but if one compares his still life in the International Exhibition with Monet's, I think it will be admitted that it makes a great advance in intellectual content.' This was followed in January 191o by the publication of an article on Cezanne by Maurice Denis, translated by Fry and with an introductory note by him claiming that 'it is generally admitted that the great and original genius . . . who really started this movement [a re- action against Impressionism], the most promising and fruit- ful of modern times, was Cezanne'. From then onwards there was no stopping him: THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE went on to carry articles by him on Bushman paintings, on the sculpture of Maillol, on a Cdzanne purchased by Helsing- fors; under his inspired editorship the whole character of the Journal was changed. Without sacrificing one jot of its erudition, it had become a battle-ground. From Fry more than from anyone else it gathered its strength. 493493,\n",

       "  THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE NUMBER 785 VOLUME CX * AUGUST 1968 Editorial Editorial HERBERT READ AND THE BURLINGTON HERBERT READ AND THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE 'THIS Magazine has lost ... one who was always ready with his help and advice, and who actually devoted a consider- able measure of his time to its interests. Much will be written about [his] achievements in scholarship and criticism, but only those who have been associated with him for more than thirty years in the venture represented by this Magazine can realize how closely he was identified with its policy, and how large a place it occupied in his life.' This is a passage that appeared in an unsigned Editorial in this Journal in Oc- tober 1934, as part of a tribute to Roger Fry's association with THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, written soon after his death, doubtless by Read himself who was then Editor. The word in our square brackets was 'Fry', but it might equally well have been 'Read' thirty-four years later. The statement applies to him as well, and could still be written in spite of of the revolution in journalism since then, because the ideals of the Magazine remain unchanged and will go on remaining so until it dies. What were these ideals that so caught Fry's imagination? Many answers could be given but none better than that furnished by Read himself in a signed editorial at the outbreak of the second world war, shortly before German and Austrian refugees were bundled into the Isle of Man: 'In the field of scholarship there is no room for national hatred or prejudice. Art is international, and as a magazine devoted to art, we have always drawn our contributions from every part of the world. My period of Editorship has coincided with a period of racial and political persecution. England has been a refuge for many foreign art historians and experts, and we have given them the means, denied to them in their own countries, of publishing their ideas and discoveries. But we have never closed our columns even to contributors who have remained in the service of a tyranni- cal and barbaric government: we have recognized that cir- cumstances sometimes demand the outward conformity of those who still inwardly maintain the truth. In an actual state of war we cannot trade with the enemy, and contributions from Germany will be withheld. But there exist in this country and elsewhere in Europe and America, German and Austrian scholars who are, in the official phrase, 'refugees from political persecution', and to these we shall continue to extend the hospitality of our pages'.1 Thus speaks the civi- lized European, the idealist tempered by the practical man of affairs. Read took over the editorship towards the end of 1933, at a moment when our financial prosperity was temporarily on the wane. But under his guidance, what we lost in advertise- ments we gained in quality of contributions. Never in its history has the reputation of the Magazine stood higher, never has the material published been of better quality, than during the six years of his editorship. It is not easy to determine how much he inherited in the way of contributions from his predecessor R. R. Tatlock when he took over, but there can be no question that he must take the credit for a new wind of vitality blowing through the editorial pages from 1933 until the outbreak of the war. He continued of course to publish contributions of importance from well-established scholars of the older generation. What was new and remark- able was the encouragement he gave to young students who had still to make their name: to Ellis Waterhouse, Martin Davies, John Pope-Hennessy, Denis Mahon, Douglas Lord, Philip Pouncey, and many others. There may be memorable articles dating from the i920's, but nothing to compare with certain contributions published when Read was in charge, which remain standard works and are still constantly con- sulted. Here is a selection of the more famous: Paul Ganz. The Castle Howard Portrait of Henry VIII. February 1934 (followed by a controversy in April). Erwin Panofsky. Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait. March 1934. Kenneth Clark. Seven Sassettas for the National Gallery. April 1935- Friedrich Antal. Reflections on Classicism and Romanticism. April 1935, May 1936 (recently republished). Martin Davies. A Portrait of the Aged Ingres [Madame Moitessier]. June 1935- Margaret Rickert. The Reconstruction of an English Carmelite Missal. September I935- Denis Mahon. Notes on the Young Guercino. March and April 1937- Richard Offner. Giotto, Non-Giotto. June and September 1939. Peggy Guggenheim has described2 how she persuaded Read in 1939 to relinquish the editorial chair of this 'stuffy' Magazine in order to become Director of a new museum of modern art in London which she was to finance and which was to open that autumn. Read was to work for six months without salary, but meanwhile had bought a partnership in Routledge, and even though with the war the museum came to nothing, .Read was by that time committed elsewhere, and had to hand over the editorship in any case. He was succeeded by A. C. Sewter in November 1939. 'This change', he wrote,3 'must still be effected, but the regret with which I resign my position is intensified by the thought of the anxie- ties which I would have gladly shared with my colleagues during the coming period of distress.' He continued until his death, however, to serve on our Editorial Board; and during the term of office of the present editor was invariably, and 1 The article is dated September 1939 and appeared in the November issue of that year. 2 Confessions of an Art Addict, London [I96O], p.6I ff. 3 In the signed article referred to in note i. 433433\n",
       "  GREGORY MARTIN Rubens's 'Dissegno Colorito' for Bishop Maes THE chequered and drawn-out history of Rubens's com- mission to execute the high altar of S. Bavo's cathedral, Ghent, which begins c.16I i when he received the commis- Ghent, which begins c.16I i when he received the commis- sion from Bishop Maes, and ends in September 1624 when sion from Bishop Maes, and ends in September 1624 when Bishop Triest's payment for the altar-piece was acknowledg- ed on Rubens's behalf, is fairly well documented.' The main document is a memorandum of March 1614, addressed to the Archduke Albert,2 in which Rubens asked him to inter- cede on his behalf with Bishop Maes's successor, Van der Burch. But exactly why Van der Burch should have persisted in rejecting Rubens's proposals has remained a mystery. It has been a matter of dispute whether Rubens's first proposals, commissioned by Bishop Maes for the altar-piece, should be identified with the oil sketch on three supports (Figs.2-4) in the National Gallery, whose authenticity has been questioned, notably by Gltick.3 Rubens, in his memor- andum to the Archduke, described his proposals for the 'tavola colle porte' as being set out in 'un dissegno colorito'; and bearing in mind the phraseology of the contract for the ceiling paintings of the Jesuit Church, Antwerp, there need be no doubt that such a phrase could have been used by Rubens to refer to an oil sketch.4 But it is necessary to cap two of the observations made by Evers,s who rightly reasserted the view that the National Gallery sketch should be so identified and dated c. 161 I-I2.6 In an unconvincing attempt to show that Rubens executed the central compartment of the sketch without the two wings in mind, Evers (echoing Gltick) observed that the architec- ture on the two wings was not well integrated with that in the centre, and thought that the episodes depicted on the wings had little justification and were more or less redundant so far as the subject was concerned. When the sketch was cleaned in I939-40, restoration work, which was known to have been carried out in the early nineteenth century, was not disturbed.7 This, or more prob- ably previous restoration work may have been more exten- sive than was then thought. For it is impossible to accept as autograph much of the paint above the figures in the fore- ground of the right-hand wing. The mucky, but freely painted sky and clumsily executed architecture etc. are hardly acceptable as the work of a seventeenth-century painter. The case of the architecture and sky at the top of the left-hand wing is less clear cut; but it is not possible to discern there the hand of Rubens with any certainty except in the large inner column. X-radiographs do not help in determin- ing whether this repainting followed Rubens's intentions. It may well have been inspired by the wish to give the sketch the appearance of a finished picture, which could easily have involved some misinterpretation or invention. Such a wish would also account for the clumsy strengthening of the steps in the central compartment and of the stone parapet on the left-hand wing. The only area of architecture which seems to be indisputably as Rubens intended is the right-hand banister, column and the adjacent, first section of the balust- rade in the central compartment.8 The figures have for the 1 See M.

MOiLLER-HOFSTEDE in Pantheon, [1967], No.x, pp.41-2, note 9, has argued for a later dating of the sketch on the grounds of stylistic similarities with the modelli, in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, for the altar-pieces of the Jesuit Church; the modelli are generally dated c.1619, although there is no pub- lished reason why they should not be a little earlier. However, the similarities are not so striking as to make his thesis convincing; the handling in the National Gal- lery sketch seems to be closer to that in the Dulwich modelli, probably of 6 io, for the outsides of the wings of the Erection of the Cross painted for S. Walburgis, one of which is reproduced by MUiller-Hofstede (his Fig.3). This supports the earlier dating for the National Gallery sketch, recently accepted by M.

       "  SHORTER NOTICES major compositions.15 His prints include a whole series of such figures in chiaroscuro woodblocks, sometimes with an added figures in chiaroscuro woodblocks, sometimes with an added intaglio plate. Some impressions of intaglio plates alone16 must intaglio plate. Some impressions of intaglio plates alone16 must be regarded as trial proofs of plates to be used in conjunction with the woodcuts. They are very rare indeed and do not appear at all complete. Of course, our print does not belong to such a series. It is much smaller and perfectly finished in drawing, modelling and shading. It must have been a parergon, to which nobody paid any attention, and which survived in this frag- mented shape by sheer accident. The technique of Beccafumi's drawings varies considerably from a highly pictorial employment of pen and brush or wildly erratic marks of the pen to a perfectly orthodox drawing style in pen or crayons with hatchings as in an engraving. 17The handling of the line in our print is half way between the two techniques. In principle it agrees with that of Beccafumi's other copper plates (Fig.49).18 The impetuosity of the line and a certain harshness in which the system of hatchings cross and sometimes clash, is to be found also in them and time and again in his drawings (Figs.5o and 52). That the figure as a whole is much more solid than usual, is explained by the fact that it is based on Michelangelo's statue. For this a parallel also exists. In a quick sketch in the Uffizi'9 Beccafumi has drawn one of Giovanni Pisano's Sibyls on the facade of the cathedral of Siena, rendering with few lines its volume and movement. It has also to be remembered that towards the end of his career he cast the eight bronze Angels in the choir of the Cathedral in Siena and planned twelve statues of the Apostles for the nave. Michelangelo's statue was certainly not only constantly before his eyes, but must also have been much in his mind. 15 D. SANMINIATELLI [1967], op. cit., Figs.47 h i 48, 55, 65, 67 a-c. 16 Ibid.

THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE Owing to the Government's restrictions in the use of electrical power and other sources of energy, and in working hours per week, it will not be possible for this Journal for the time being to continue to produce a monthly issue of its accustomed length. We have therefore been obliged to reduce the number of edi- torial pages per issue. It has been decided that material that is already in stock, that is to say main articles, Shorter Notices and book reviews, out of consideration for both authors and readers, should not be curtailed, but that temporarily we should cut down material of a more topical character which is commissioned month by month, that is to say the exhibition reviews and articles concerning recent museum acquisitions. We apologise to readers, and to authors who have already been asked to contri- bute to the columns we are proposing to eliminate, for this in- convenience. But if we were not to impose these restrictions, it would be impossible for the printers to bring out any issue even approximately on time. We hope to produce retrospective notices of the more important exhibitions and museum acquisi- tions if and when the situation improves. Letter Mortimer Drawings SIR, In THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE for August, 1973, there is a short article by Professor Marcia Allentuck entitled 'New John Hamilton Mortimer Drawings of Shakespearean Characters' (P.530). In this article Professor Allentuck lists eight drawings which she attributes to Mortimer. They come from a graingerized set of Shakespeare's works in royal folio in the Henry E. Hunting- ton Library, San Marino, California, Professor Allentuck informs us. Firstly I should say that we are indebted to her for bringing these drawings to light and publishing them. However, two of these drawings are, I think, by Mortimer; the other six seem to me to be copies. Apart from the evidence of the eye alone, which in my opinion is proof enough in this case, there is further supporting evidence for my contention. The three previously known clearly original drawings by Mortimer for the engraved Shakespearean series (i775/6) have the following in common: All are in reverse of the etchings, as one would under normal circumstances expect; all are on the same kind of paper of a slightly yellowish coarse-grained nature; all are executed in pen and ink in a tight, highly finished style which gives the impression, at first glance, that they are them- selves etchings - this technique of pen and ink drawing, which uses the hatchings and dottings normally associated with the medium of etching itself, belongs particularly to Mortimer's drawing style of the mid-i 770's and is very often associated with finished drawings for etchings, whether executed by Mortimer himself, as in the case of the Shakespearean heads, or by another engraver such as Robert Blyth; lastly, all the drawings are the same size, give or take a fraction of an inch, i.e. c. 131 by c. i I ins., about the same size, in fact, as the engravings themselves. These three drawings are for the following Shakespearean characters: Edgar (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 33'3 by 27 cm.), Shylock (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 33-6 by 27'3 cm.), and Beatrice (Dr F. Cummings collection, Detroit, USA, 34'3 by 29-2 cm.). On this basis, as well as on the evidence of the eye alone, it seems clear that of the eight drawings which Professor Allentuck refers to in her article, the Poet (Fig.63 in the article) and Ophelia (Fig.67 in the article) are original Mortimer drawings. The other six seem to me to be copies, either taken from the etchings them- selves, or from the drawings for them. Of these six, the four pen and ink ones are to my mind sloppy and ill-drawn, aping Mortimer's style but with little success, except possibly in the case of the Bardolph (Fig.58 in the article). None of these four are in oval format, though they are nearly all the same size, c.28.5 by 22-23 cm. All except the Lear (Fig.64 in the article), are in the same direction as the etchings, which suggests that they are probably copies of the latter. The Lear, though in reverse of the etching, is a terribly weak drawing, in my opinion. The two pastel drawings, which are admittedly the same size as the above mentioned original drawings and in oval format, but in the same direction as the etchings, are to my mind copies of the latter. Mortimer rarely used pastel or chalk as far as we know, and most of the known drawings by him in this medium date from his student days in the late 1750's and are mainly heads done in the style of Piazzetta. There are also further known drawings in pastel, which I believe to be copies of the etchings, in the same series, of Richard II, Bardolph and another Falstaf, all in the same direction as the etchings. I do not accept myself that the six drawings discussed by Professor Allentuck, apart from the Poet and Ophelia already mentioned, could be preliminary studies rather than the finished drawings for the etchings; they seem to me to be too weak in drawing and execution. It should be borne in mind, in this connection, that the Shakespearean heads series was very popular in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and thus copies of the etchings and even the original drawings are only to be expected. As far as the problem of direction is concerned, I do not believe it is necessary to confuse the issue where no confusion actually io8108,\n",

       " THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE NUMBER 889 VOLUME CXIX APRIL 1977 Editorial BENEDICT NICOLSON AND THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE THIS is the first issue of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE for exactly thirty years in which the Editorial has not been written by the Editor himself, Benedict Nicolson, or under his direct supervision; the Editorial Board of Directors has decided to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to his extraordinarily long and brilliant running of the journal. This may at first sight appear to be an almost narcissistic procedure. In congratulating our Editor and in admiring his achievements do we not come uncomfortably close to con- gratulating ourselves? No-one who has sat on a committee with Benedict Nicolson (as each one of us has done) could possibly believe this to be the case. He has, of course, been known to take advice - but where it has gone against the grain, that advice has been very rapidly forgotten, and the printed minutes of our meetings do not always seem to correspond exactly to what we remember to have taken place. THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, as it has existed for the last thirty years, is the creation of Benedict Nicolson alone, and we need therefore feel no compunction in expressing our gratitude and enthusiasm for what he has made of it. THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE is (and this must rank very high in our estimation) a journal whose editorial section has remained wholly unaffected by the increasingly lavish (and increasingly alluring) advertisements which have accom- panied the art boom and which have necessarily provided virtually all its revenue. It has attracted new and lively talent from all over the world, while always maintaining the very highest scholarly levels, for as an editor Nicolson has managed to combine great encouragement for a bewildering variety of topics and approaches with a rigorous eye for accuracy - a whole generation of art historians must by now be familiar with his kindly but tough probing of just those weaknesses in some article which - so one hoped - might escape detection. And it has (to a remarkable extent) managed to escape the pedantic dullness as well as the silliness that are so conspicuously characteristic of our pro- fession. Here perhaps the very limitations on length which were necessary just after the war proved to be an advantage which our Editor (himself an outstanding writer) has sub- sequently been able to exploit with tact and shrewdness. THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE did not, of course, emerge from nothing in I947 (as Nicolson has reminded us in a recent article in the Connoisseur, March 1975, PP. 175-83) - but, after a brilliant if chequered early history, it was in a bad way. For four years there had been no editor at all, and the journal had been run by two members of the Board of Directors and an assistant editor. It must be difficult for most of our readers to envisage what this can have involved under the prevailing circumstances; it must have been even harder for the Board to have realized how brilliantly it had solved its problems when it finally chose as Editor a man of 32 whose only previous post had been that of Deputy Surveyor of the King's Pictures for a few months before the outbreak of the war. Perhaps one of Nicolson's outstanding achievements was to take advantage of an unusually lucky situation - for the successful editor, like the successful general, can only exploit the opportunities that are available to him. English univer- sities suddenly discovered the existence of art history, and English governments and town councils even made cautious moves to encourage the wider appreciation of art; great scholar refugees, freed from war-work, demonstrated that other approaches to the study of the visual arts were possible besides that of traditional connoisseurship (which has, how- ever, never been neglected in these pages); tastes changed almost as rapidly as the developments of modern art - the Baroque, the Neo-Classical, the Nineteenth-Century 'Aca- demics' all began to find vigorous and informed champions; new circumstances made contacts with America and much of the Continent closer than ever before - have there ever been three decades during which so many international con- ferences of all kinds have been held? And the same has applied to exhibitions; despite memories of a few stupendous pre-war occasions, there can surely be no doubt that (to name a selection almost at random) the series devoted to themes such as the Gothic, the Rococo, the Neo-Cla.ssical held in various cities under the auspices o& the Council of Europe, and certain others devoted to individual artists (Reni, the Carracci, Guercino, Barocci, etc. at Bologna; Poussin in Paris; and so on) have marked a wholly new departure in the stimulus they have given to scholarship. Not all these events have been desirable (doubts about the multiplication of exhibitions have indeed been expressed in these pages), but all have been reflected in THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE under Nicolson's editorship, and they have thus helped to give this phase in the journal's history a distinct character of its own. Great editors necessarily colour the journals they edit, and this can sometimes be dangerous. Nicolson certainly has strongly expressed and idiosyncratic views of his own which are not shared by everyone (one member of this Board visualizes a typical 'Nicolson picture' as portraying a rather grubby and very wrinkled old man, harshly illuminated by a guttering candle, as he gazes quizzically at a flask of urine ...), but even to those who know him well it comes as something of a surprise to discover how very wide-ranging his interests have been. The proof is to be found in the pages that follow, for (at our suggestion) the Editor has agreed to include in this issue only articles which deal with subjects on which he himself has written. The scope (from the end of the fifteenth century until the present day) is impressively wide by any standards, and is indeed astonishing in view of the time he has had to devote to this journal. But such a passing reference can give no indication of the quality of his major books and articles; and this needs to be stressed (even if it cannot here be analysed) because there can be no doubt that it has played a major role in his editorship. Art critics (even good art critics) are often failed painters; editors (even good editors) are often failed writers. But Nicolson is a successful writer and a major scholar who has attracted important contributions very largely on the strength of his own reputation. 229 \n",
       " EDITORIAL Readers will be relieved to know that though the past tense has necessarily been frequently used during the course of this exceptional editorial, it has no bearing whatsoever on the circumstances of the journal. Benedict Nicolson is still at his desk, and will - as soon as this issue is in print - no doubt continue to forget our advice and ignore our occasional protests. For all his incomparable services to THE BURLING- TON MAGAZINE, this is perhaps the right moment to remind him that Sir Bruce Ingram edited the Illustrated London News for sixty-three years. J. D. BISHOP F. E. HIPKIN BRINSLEY FORD PHILIP POUNCEY NICHOLAS GOODISON ELLIS WATERHOUSE FRANCIS HASKELL BENEDICT NICOLSON Stomer Brought Up-to-date* WHEN I announced to a friend who works in the Louvre that I was embarking on a study of Matthias Stomer, he protested that the painter was 'tropfacilement reconnaissable' - enough to damp down my ardour for a while. It has to be admitted that Stomer no longer presents great problems of attribution. He will never mislead us by rising to the heights; will never take wing on a gust of air, strong enough to transform his vision of life and hence his style so that it becomes unrecognisable, as an artist of genius will do. He cultivates a well-trimmed garden; or to put it nastily, repeats himself over and over again. A full-scale Stomer exhibition would be a catastrophe. All the same, there remain new things to be said on the art- historical level. Since the standard work on Stomer (1953)1 it is possible to be a little more precise about his chronology and sources. Moreover, some twenty pictures can now be added to the 130 or so already known, which though they may give us no hint of a new dimension, are surely worth putting on record for their own sake. I am bound to repeat certain well known facts, but in the process, at least I can dispel some misapprehensions. The first we hear of Stomer is in the Strada dell'Ormo, Rome in the parish of S. Nicola in Arcione in 1630-32 where a 'Signor Mattheo Sthom (or Sthem or Schem), fliamingo pittore' is recorded as residing aged 30-32 years2. He was therefore born around the turn of the century. It is always claimed that he came from Amersfoort, but on what authority no one has established. The pictures proclaim that he spent some of his youth in Utrecht and Antwerp.3 In an inventory of 1648 he is actually described as a pupil of the leading Caravaggesque painter in Utrecht, Honthorst,4 and though it could well be true, this was proclaimed miles away in Sicily and two decades later, and should not be taken too literally. He is next heard of in Naples, but at what date after 1632 it is impossible to determine. In 16925 many night scenes by 'Matteo Tomar Fiamenghi' are noted in the Capucin Church of S. Efremo Nuovo; in 17896 two pictures are described as being behind the high altar there, a Christ at the Column crowned with Thorns and a Crucifixion with weeping angels by 'Giovanni Stomer Tedesco'; and in 186o7 four pictures are described in the same location, a St Francis in ecstasy before the Infant Jesus, a St Anthony of Padua, a Christ at the Column and a Crowning with Thorns. However mutually incompatible these testimonies may be,8 it is clear that none of these pictures can be identified with the ones now at Capodimonte or transferred to other institutions from the Naples Museums (see below, notes 17, 18), and were evidently dispersed in 1865 when the Church and Convent of S. Efremo were transformed into a house of correction. We are reduced to determining Stomer's Neapolitan phase from a study of the * The numbers in brackets after paintings and drawings by Stomer mentioned in the text and notes refer to the numbers allotted to the lists of his works published in an appendix at the end of this essay. This is necessary since the lists are organised within four categories (A-D), so that individual works might not be at once identifiable without this system of cross-referencing. I have made acknowledgements in the notes to scholars who have helped me on points of detail, but a general acknowledgement is due to Luisa Vertova who provided me from Italy with some obscure early texts not available to me in London; and to Dr John Cauchi of Rabat (Malta) and Dr Nicola Spinosa of Capodimonte for information about and photographs of pictures at Valletta and Naples respectively.

SPEAR: Caravaggio and His Followers, Cleveland [197I] (hereafter referred to as SPEAR [971 ]), under No.37 tells us that Stomer studied under A.

There are or were only three works signed by Stomer himself: a Tobias and the Angel (5) in the Bredius Museum at The Hague, signed 'M. Stom'; the Martyrdom of St Cecilia formerly in the Church of the Cappuccini, Messina, signed 'Flandriae Stomus coloribus expressit' (see P. HACKERT: Memorie dei Pittori Messinesi e degli Esteri [ 1821 ], p. 18o) or according to another reading 'exprexit'; and the ex-Caccamo St Isidore (I31) signed 'Matthias Stom' (see below, note 9). So he himself did favour the form 'Stom'. The inscription 'Mattia Stomer' on mount and reverse of the Opp6 drawing after Caravaggio (18) is clearly not a signature. An inscription 'M. STOMfecit' disappeared from the Heim Christ at Emmaus (50o) in an early cleaning. 230 ,\n",

       "  THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE VOLUME CXXII ? NUMBER 928 * JULY 1980 Editorial Editorial Contemporary art and Contemporary art and The Burlington Magazine A journal devoted to the history of art treads cautiously as it comes to examine the art of the recent past. In theory there is no reason why that should be. A historian's duty is to present the facts, to be as dispas- sionate as possible about the particular works and artists under investigation. We know from experience that such objectivity is desirable but rare. Critical opinion, per- sonal bias and popular esteem colour the historian's selection. It is here that the more interesting if less ac- curate reading is to be found. A glance at the contents pages of this magazine, from its first number in 1903, vividly demonstrates that the historian changes the cut of his clothes like everyone else. To a considerable extent he has been an arbiter of taste. Sixty years ago it would have been inconceivable, unpardonable even, to have devoted an issue of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE to the Pre- Raphaelites, as was to happen in 1973 (although not without a blush on the editorial cheek). In earlier years there was a sizable number of articles on eighteenth- century English painting, particularly portraiture; relatively few such articles appeared post-Duveen. Ex- amples of similar changes can be multiplied; another is the development of seventeenth-century Italian studies, a field in which Benedict Nicolson made a highly signifi- cant contribution. But it would be inaccurate to suggest that historians and dealers were mainly responsible for such changes. Artists themselves frequently anticipate what the historian will next enunciate and classify. The Cubists and African sculpture is a familiar example, the Pre-Raphaelites and Botticelli is another; nearer our own time American artists of the sixties were among the first to discover the delights of Art Deco. The art historian is often ruthlessly unopinionated, when dealing with his own subject safely tucked away in- to a decade or two of the fifteenth or the eighteenth cen- turies. With more recent art he expresses timid opinions and is more emotional in his reactions. This seems to be the conclusion we can draw, with some exceptions, from the pages of the magazine. Commentary on contemporary art has been sporadic since the magazines's foundation and the idea of a special issue devoted to the twentieth century is relatively recent. Between about 1910 and 1920 the magazine was at its most up to date. 'In the chaste pages of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE,' to quote D. S. MacColl, 'barely tainted with modern art, there appeared, with Mr Fry's editorial blessing, a startling rhapsody on CEzanne'. This, by Maurice Denis, was in 1910; the English were catching up and abuse inevitably followed. Why allot space to MM. Matisse and Picasso which might more gracefully have been consecrated to various amici and alunni? Fry was unrepentant and contributors on recent art included Walter Sickert, Arthur Clutton-Brock, Clive Bell, W. G. Constable and R. R. Tatlock. Fry's own writings on con- temporary artists are more often found in other papers but he did write in THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE On Maillol, Gaudier and Dobson, on Kauffer and Anrep, on Larionov and Matisse. Many regarded these reviews as aberrations. Even his articles on Van Gogh, Cezanne and Seurat in the 'twenties and 'thirties were still red rags to most readers. Fry's last book review was an appreciative reception of Herbert Read's Art Now (May 1934). Read, who was Editor from 1933 to 1939, also reserved his writings on recent art for more appropriate columns and his few Burlington articles are mainly on Gothic and early Renaissance subjects. There was no continuously published journal between the wars which dealt in- telligently with recent art; Studio, once so lively, created 'a cordon sanitaire down the middle of the English Chan- nel'. Others were short-lived or, like Axis, served only a particular group. The pages of The Listener under J. R. Ackerley reveal some of the most lively criticism of the time and an unusual seriousness of attitude. But articles of an historical nature were scarce. After the war, during Benedict Nicolson's editorship, many important contributions appeared on late nine- teenth and early twentieth-century painting and there was an appreciable increase in the number of reviews of contemporary exhibitions. But they were almost ex- clusively given over to French and British painting and sculpture. Russian, German and American art fared badly. Such is THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE'S reputation and so many are the periodicals in America devoted to indigenous art, that historians there would hardly con- template sending us their findings on Eakins or Hopper, Pollock or Johns. Looking back through some of the re- cent reviews of American art, there would seem little temptation for them to do so. Douglas Cooper, a major contributor on French painting, wrote of de Kooning as 'shallow, boisterous and uncertain' (along with Francis Bacon at the 1954 Venice Biennale) and Jasper Johns's 1964 Whitechapel retrospective was received way off mark. On the other hand the more accessible Hopper was handsomely treated by Jerrold Lanes in 1965. There are of course pitfalls in writing about recent art in an essentially historical magazine. The training of art historians and their particular methods are not always conducive to an examination of rapid change, diverse techniques and the spilling over of established genres and formats into other disciplines. Living artists in mid- career may alter the course of their art and by so doing, necessitate a broader perspective in which to see their earlier work. Such moves can often make a mockery of the kind of historical examinations familiar from these pages. But there are splendid compensations in the con- nections established and the opinions generated. Scholar- ship does not hang up its gloves at Cubism. Historical ar- ticles on recent art prevent that dislocation between history and criticism frequently found in a journal such as this. It is hoped that the present issue, with its discus- sion of unfamiliar aspects of two modern masters and an examination of one of the most esteemed younger artists working now, will point in that direction. 463463,\n",

       "  SHORTERNOTICES OBITUARY his presence in Bologna would not have affected their decision. Altar-pieces tended to reach their destinations and remain Altar-pieces tended to reach their destinations and remain there, but there was no rule about this. Nicholas Froment's there, but there was no rule about this. Nicholas Froment's Raising of Lazarus changed hands twice in quick succession,26 while Fra Bartolommeo's God the Father and Saints Catherine of Siena and Mary Magdalen never made its way to Venice as origi- nally intended, and instead ended up in Lucca.27 Finally, the document tells us how much the work was deemed to be worth. It was valued at 150 lire, but it could be interesting to know if that is what Parmigianino was paid, or whether the nuns were making a profit.28 At all events, the nuns were unabashed about using their altar-piece as barter, and it was worth less than a third of the value of the property. These would have been facts of life for Parmigianino: we should bear them in mind when looking at his paintings. 26 It passed from Cardinal Francesco Coppini to Cosimo de' Medici, and from him to San Francesco al Bosco, all between 1461 and 1464. For an excellent discussion of the vicissitudes of the picture, see M. S. GRAYSON: 'The Northern Origin of Nicholas Froment's Resurrection of Lazarus Altarpiece in the Uffizi Gallery', Art Bulletin, Vol. LVIII [1976], pp.350-57. I am grateful to Lorne Campbell for pointing this out to me. 27 The original patron was Bartolommeo Dalzano of San Pietro Martire on Murano, but it ended up with Sante Pagnini at San Romano in Lucca.

MARCHESE: Memorie dei piz Insigni Pittori, Scultori e Architetti Domenicani, Bologna [1879], pp.60-67, and F: KNAPP: Fra Bartolommeo della Porta und die Schule von San Marco, Halle [1903], p.273, for the relevant documents. I am grateful to Patricia Rubin for pointing this out to me. 28 It is not unreasonable to suppose that a finished picture would be more expensive, if only because its delivery and quality were assured. Obituary Anthony Blunt, art historian (1907-1983) Anthony Blunt was deliberately sparing of statements of doctrine, and his writings do not yield up a neat collection of maxims which can be strung together to resume his philoso- phy, or even his method. I shall therefore follow the rule which he himself formulated in discussing that elusive term, 'baro- que' and shall seek to define 'rather by example than by abs- tract principles'. The Cambridge dissertation which was the basis of his first book, Artistic theory in Italy, 1450-1600 [1940, republished 1956] already exemplifies this position. In this, which is a useful book, if not a great one ('Now I should not dare to write such a book at all', he wrote significantly in 1956), he examined the theories put forward in renaissance treatises, emphasising the artists' attempt to advance their cultural status by propound- ing theories, and the subsequent adaptation of those theories in reponse to social change. The only value of the treatises themselves is to reassure us that features which we analyse today in the art of the past are not merely 'the creation of our imagination'. There is no a priori aesthetic, and there is no norm. Blunt, with Blake, believes that 'to generalise is to be an idiot'. This cautious pragmatism, which insists that the value of concepts and of 'labels' is strictly instrumental, is of course perfectly in keeping with British traditions of thought. But in Anthony's case it was accompanied by a quite remarkable capacity for organising his material with a lucidity which is often considered to be a French virtue. This combination was perhaps the basis of his scholarly authority and of his remark- ably effective teaching, of which I can speak with gratitude and a sense of loss. Few academic careers can have been so uniformly success- ful. After the early years at Cambridge and abroad - Paris, Rome and elsewhere - intensely varied and including some journalism, Anthony joined the Warburg Institute (1937-39) which had just moved to London; was then appointed Deputy Director of the recently founded Courtauld Institute (1939-47, except of course, for the war years); and was from 1947 to 1974 Director of that Institute, which, as we know, he turned into a centre of excellence of world stature. It was largely due to Anthony's wisdom and shrewdness as director of the Cour- tauld that the history of Western art, which had until then seemed to be merely a pastime for foreigners, was able at last to take its place in British university and academic life. We in France, confronted with the same cultural problems, admired and envied this development - an achievement to which a special number of the Revue de l'Art (No.30, 1975) paid sincere tribute. Many art historians derive continuing and posthumous glory from the greatness of the artists on whom they work. The name of Roberto Longhi is forever linked with that of Caravaggio, as that of Charles de Tolnay is to Michelangelo. All his life Anthony Blunt was Nicolas Poussin's man. Ellis Waterhouse has described how his schoolfellow Anthony, at the age of fifteen, was already convinced that Poussin was a figure of immense stature, waiting to be rediscovered. Anthony worked long and patiently at that rediscovery, drawing on the example of two masters of iconological and stylistic analysis, Fritz Saxl and Walter Friedlinder, and collaborating with the latter on the magisterial project The Drawings of Nicolas Poussin [1939 onwards]. After his first articles on the artist's writings [1939] and the philosophical background to his works [1944] almost every year marked a further step in the incredibly steady advance of Blunt's Poussin studies. This sequence of articles carefully distinguished the pupils from the master, copies from originals, whimsical accretions from the authentic kernel - the long unravelling of a great confusion. Of course not everything is still accepted by the Poussin-Forscher: yet few scholars have been able to use so effectively that rare pincer- like combination of documentary evidence and stylistic analysis to define a painting and to sift an auvre. When, in conjunction with the Poussin exhibition at the Louvre (originally planned for 1957, then postponed till 1960), we decided to hold a symposium on the artist, Anthony ani- mated and dominated the event, as the cataloguer of the forth- coming exhibition, and as Walter Friedliinder's collaborator on the publication of the drawings. He had just given the 1957 Mellon lectures, which were to be the starting point of his great three-volume work [1966-67], in which he expounded, in best Warburgian fashion, his interpretation of Poussin's stoic thought (we are reminded in a famous anecdote how much this had astounded Bernini), complementing it by reference to Campanella's naturalistic and pantheistic philosophy, the only contemporary analogue for the Four seasons and the other last great masterpieces. And last of all came the swift, uncluttered, elegant book on Poussin's drawings [1979]. The use of lan- guage here is sparser and stricter than ever; and when Blunt evokes the moral density of Poussin's slightest sketch, one is tempted to apply to the art historian the proud words which the painter-philosopher, writing to Chantelou, used of himself: 'je ne suis point homme lIger ni changeant d'affection quandje l'ai mise en un sujet' (Poussin, p.266). The preoccupation with Poussin was the focal point of Anthony's wide-ranging studies on French seventeenth- century art, supreme among which is that masterpiece of didactic lucidity Art and Architecture in France 1500-1700 (Pelican History of Art [1953], 4th edition [1982]). Anthony was well 546546\n",
       "  OBITUARY enough aware of the limitations of his Francois Mansart [1941]1 to encourage the subsequent publication of a more exhaustive critical study; both it and Philibert Delorme [1958] grew out of his teaching, and if they did not articulate a methodology, they his teaching, and if they did not articulate a methodology, they did lay certain ground rules for the study of architecture. Since did lay certain ground rules for the study of architecture. Since architecture came to absorb him more and more, his activity in this field merits close attention. His historical approach was consistent and clear. In all his writings he would sketch the political framework within which intellectual and stylistic developments occurred. His Corneille-Poussin parallel is a masterly example of this method. History is seen as a whole, in which no one element dominates another; all are part of a broad current, the course of which has to be charted. The historian's task is to map the significant landmarks, while avoiding the twin dangers of idealist Geistesgeschichte and Marxist sociological reductionism, to the latter of which Anthony was momentarily attracted while at Cambridge. In a review published in this Magazine in June 1980 discussing Jean Duvet's response to the civil wars of the sixteenth century, he significantly suggested that artists frequently remain aloof from contemporary ideological debates. Appointed Surveyor of the Royal Collections in succession to Kenneth Clark in 1945, Anthony carried out his duties with characteristic punctiliousness, most enduringly in the publica- tion of the Windsor collections of Old Master drawings. Hav- ing as his colleague in this undertaking the incomparable Johannes Wilde, he assigned sections of the catalogue to ack- nowledged experts, while he himself tackled the French draw- ings (with Margaret Whinney [1945]) and the Drawings of G.B. Castiglione and Stefano della Bella [1954]. The overall evaluation of Castiglione given in this double monograph seems to me very characteristic: 'though a great part of his work conforms to the rather obvious emotionalism of the Italian baroque, in his few very late drawings he attains real intensity of dramatic expression'. Behind that statement lies an instinctive mistrust of Mediterranean pathos and of a rhetoric suspected of empti- ness. Anthony Blunt epitomised the virtues of reticence and sang-froid. There was no trace of romanticism in approach, writings or style; I remember him telling me: 'aufond,j'ai hor- reur de Ruskin'. This revulsion against Victorian emotionalism ran deep and it doubtless explains his interest in eccentrics and rebels, the most remarkable for him being that eccentric Brit- ish artist par excellence, William Blake [1959]. No less revealing was his admiration for the most 'intellectual' of French pain- ters, Seurat [1965] and his - admittedly sporadic - interest in the implacable creator of Guernica [1967]. Although a great traveller, Anthony took little part in the big international gatherings which were then in vogue. Con- gresses were not his thing. But he did attend the 1961 New York congress and in his introduction to the 'Baroque and Antiquity' section [1963] he set out the basis of what was to be a major preoccupation in the following years. He argued that 'Baroque in the narrow sense', i.e. the style predominant in Italy in the 1620s, encompassed at least two distinct strands of antique influence; the Vitruvians, the rigorists - or, if you like, the classicists - had no monopoly of antique forms. 'If the ancient sources used by Borromini were collected, I believe they would make a list almost as consistent as the correspond- ing series of models used by Poussin' (p. 11). It was virtually a declaration of intent. Anthony now returned to subjects which had first attracted him in 1933-34 while at the British School in Rome. The Robertsons' 1965 Summer School in Sicily led to a photo- graphic survey with Tim Benton, and ultimately to his pictor- ial record, Sicilian Baroque [1968]; ever methodical, he at once moved on in the same spirit to tackle Neapolitan Baroque and Rococo: Architecture and Decoration [1978], setting out his descrip- tive and historical approach in the introduction to the catalogue Civilta del '700 a Napoli 1734-1791 [1979]. The enorm- ous advantage of this survey technique, despite shortcomings of detail, was that it enabled him to use plans and photographs as a focus for historical material, which deserved to be set in an international context - a task at which Anthony naturally excelled. His last work of this sort, a form of catalogue, was his Guide to Baroque Rome [1982], an up-to-date version of the Mirabilia Urbis Romae aimed at the cultured visitor who has replaced the pilgrim, and in that sense a pendant to Ellis Waterhouse's book on Roman painting [1976]. This last guide was the backdrop to his great work on Pietro da Cortona, to be published in the near future. There was, then, an Italianising Anthony, focussed on the baroque, as well as the other Anthony, historian of 'French' classicism. The two coincided, of course, in the Rome of Nicolas Poussin. In 1967, when Anthony was presented with his sixtieth birthday Festschrift,* half the articles it contained were on France, half on Italy - an indication of a conflict of interests and an inner tension which mirrored the Roman bat- tle of the styles; for two completely different 'human land- scapes', two utterly diverse art-historical premises, were needed to encompass these two objects of his life-long enthusiasm. On the 'Poussin' side are strong personalities, requiring close critical attention, aloof from all around them, standing proud of their historical setting, which has indeed to be re- defined to accommodate them. On the other side lie a land- scape and a society of evident physical beauty, in which shared traditions of materials, patronage and formal vocabulary have imprinted on every building a general family resemblance. The problem here is rather to define the role of personalities. In both cases, the task of the interpreter is to investigate 'the most subtle variations' within a 'severely limited set of conven- tions'; with Poussin those restraints are the result of personal choice, in the other case of social convention. Ultimately, one is forced to confront the insuperable problem, inherent in all art history: the relationship between the individual artist and society. It is significant that Anthony tackled it only by exam- ple. He typified the indefatigable British taste for travel, a prere- quisite of any serious Kunsthistoriker. The labour of compiling our card indexes dislocates the work of art, just as analytic interpretation confers on it an artificial transparency. Inves- tigation in situ restores the work of art to its real world, and gives us once more the shock and pleasure of the actual object in all its opacity. It was with evident pleasure that in his last published book Anthony, normally so reserved, so reticent, announced: 'I have visited - by which I mean been inside - almost all the churches covered in this handbook'. I was strongly reminded of a day we spent together in Paris, visiting the scattered and neglected remains of Philibert Delorme's Tuileries. Art historians are travellers through space and time, whose success may be judged by their capacity to encourage others to undertake similar journeys. Anthony Blunt would, I think, have agreed with that view of his task, and in it he succeeded brilliantly. In spite of occasional weaknesses in detail, omis- sions, perhaps even certain faults, such a master, whose sta- ture will remain evident to all, deserves our tribute.

       "  THE EARLIEST YEARS OF THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE: A BRIEF RETROSPECT I WRITTEN BY MICHAEL LEVEY LM I WRITTEN BY MICHAEL LEVEY LM gladly embrace the occasion', sonorously gladly embrace the occasion', sonorously announced Henry James on making his appearance in The Burlington Magazine, with a highly characteristic obituary of Charles Eliot Norton, published in the number for January 1910.o One might echo his words in responding to the invitation from the present editor to turn back, on the occasion of this millennium, to peruse.and ponder on the Burlington in its earliest, Edwardian years, which can reasonably be allowed to stretch beyond the strict limit of the reign to the outbreak of the First World War. With James, having penned his elaborate and yet faintly elusive tribute ('I see how interesting a case, above all, my distinguished friend was ever to remain to me. . .'), there came a moment not of embrace but of distinct recoil on learning of the Magazine's rates of pay. By chance or not, he never appeared again in its pages. The first number of The Burlington Magazine was over 140 pages in length and as handsome in appearance as in substance. Published in March 1903, from an address in New Burlington Street, it had an effectively designed, purely typographical cover, boldly declaring under the classic let- tering of its title that it was 'for Connoisseurs' (Fig. 5). Two years before, incidentally, there had started The Connoisseur, 6. Roger Fry, c. 1925. Photograph by Ramsey and Muspratt. declared on its cover to be 'for Collectors', a point graphically vivid by the accompanying illustration devised Byam Shaw. Although published in London, the Burlington was available in Paris, Brussels, Leipzig and New York Florence and Amsterdam were rapidly added- and its national character was established from the first. And, in certain ways, the tone of the Magazine was estab- lished from the first: in its editorials and its features, no less than in its articles. The chief hero of the Burlington in those early years was undoubtedly Roger Fry (Fig.6), much involved in its founding, in raising funds for it as it encountered an early financial crisis and, above all, in writing for it with im- pressive frequency and impressive width of range. '(It) is to be', he wrote privately of the new venture, 'as far as possible an expression of authoritative opinion'. When he later sought, successfully, to persuade Charles Holmes to act as joint editor, he stated his belief that the Magazine could become 'a very powerful influence for the kind of serious and schol- arly study of the subject which we have at heart'. In the early numbers, however, Fry detected an element of bric-ai-brac articles, a tendency not perhaps totally ex- tinguished until after the First War. Ironically, those oc- casional effusions - somewhat on the lines of 'chats on old china' - now seem part of a period charm, even if no more than the literary equivalent of the tissue-paper interleaving then placed between full-page illustrations and text. They certainly juxtapose piquantly to the scholarly articles of such varied authorities as Berenson, Weale, Alfred Pollard, van der Put and Campbell Dodgson, as well as Fry himself. In rather the same way, the earliest accompanying advertisements (some in full colour, as were some plates in the Magazine proper) now exercise their appeal, particularly 'for Con- noisseurs'. In themselves, the advertisements serve as a reminder of an artistic world long vanished, which, looked back on, seems wonderfully leisured and spacious, if not entirely serene, with an air which it would be harsh to call amateurish and which is possibly no more than an ineradicable, enviable aestheticism. Hodges of South Kensington, 'opposite the Oratory', advertised themselves in a phrase E.F. Benson might have borrowed, as the firm, 'for quaint furniture', glozing that as covering Sheraton and Hepplewhite, and also 'the French style'. The London Stereoscopic Co. drew readers' attention to the fact that it was the agent for 'Clyde Motor Bicycles'. Further afield, in Inverness actually, the Old Curiosity Shop had 'always on view a MAGNIFICENT COLLECTION' of antique furniture, old prints, engravings and oil paintings and curious old brass work, 'Highland and other curios'. Broadwoods took a whole page to illustrate a semi-grand pianoforte (Fig.7), 'in the style Louis XVI', with the evocative history of having been 'lately sent to Marlboro' House for use of H.I.M. The Shah of Persia'. The Burlington had come into being, as its first editorial explained, to remove an anomaly it called curious and shame- ful: 'that Britain, alone of all cultured European countries, is without any periodical which makes the serious and dis- interested study of ancient art its chief preoccupation'.

Boadwod ianoort, adertsed n th Maazin, Mrch 903 important than its first editor, Robert Dell, anyway soon superseded, was the nucleus of the first Consultative Com- mittee, which included Benedite, Molinier and Reinach, as well as Berenson, Colvin, Lionel Cust and Herbert Home, in addition to most of the names already cited. Nothing could have been less parochial, and the results were soon apparent in the remarkable range of subjects and periods covered. The Burlington could call on Bode for a magisterial book review, scrutinise the acquisitions made by the national collections and survey some of the major works of art on the market (taking account of, for example, a statuette by Pigalle, not then a name to stir much interest in England). It also took account of current periodical literature abroad. Fry seems often to have been responsible for these detailed surveys, stigmatising a wrong attribution to Piero della Francesca in the Gazette des Beaux-Arts, commending articles on Brouwer and Pacher in Repertorium fiir Kunstwissenschaft and noting as remarkable the drawings of a modern Belgian artist, Dirk Nijland, published in Onze Kunst. It was Fry who gave a long, laudatory review to Horne's Botticelli, when it was published in 1908. Silly or trivial books seem to have been largely ignored, though Sir Joshua Reynolds, by a certain Elsa D'Esterre Keeling, was noticed by Holmes, with un- typical tartness: 'Miss Keeling has in fact undertaken a task which was quite beyond her powers, and does not appear to have realised it.' The review Bode gave to Maud Cruttwell's book on the Pollaiuolo was certainly critical, not least of the influence on it of Berenson; and it drew a joint letter of protest from Colvin and Claude Phillips, smugly and sur- prisingly asserting that its tone was 'not one customary on this side of the North Sea'. A few years later, and there were graver matters to separate countries on either side of the North Sea. The profound shock of the outbreak of a European war, with all its impli- cations for art and art treasures, reverberated through the pages of the Burlington. It was an editorial that after five years of the Magazine's existence had declared that 'We have consistently appealed to commonsense rather than to passion'. And when war broke out, the Burlington showed how earnestly it meant that, by bravely asking for German books to be distributed to prisoners-of-war. Nevertheless, an ominous 'Special Notice' appeared in the number for Sep- tember 1914: 'In face of the present international situation, we must accept that for a time interest in art and the history of art is likely to give place to more violent claims on the attention of the public'. A month later the Magazine was itself starting to reflect some of the new claims, unsure of the fate of the Town Hall at Louvain and carrying a report- by Robert C. Witt - on a visit to the battlefields of Northern France. By 1917 Austrian bombers had been sighted over the Piazza di San Marco at Venice, and in a tragic context the name of Tiepolo entered the pages of the Burlington, with an account of the destruction of his Scalzi ceiling. Before 1914 the editorials had marked public events such as the death of Edward VII (in a 'quiet and unostentatious way (he) strove to assist the cause of the fine arts in his dominions') and the loss to the country of Rembrandt's Mill. In the latter case, it was, an editorial of I911 stated 'plainly', the Burlington's duty to indicate 'that the Trustees of the National Gallery have, as a body, conspicuously failed in the trust which has been placed upon them.' Other exports caused equally severe assessments, and not for the last time did an editorial look for an official explanation that was not forthcoming. A very great distance seems, on the other hand, to separate us from those early years when major articles, or quite minor ones, dealt with major figures and facts now established and accepted. 'A Forgotten Painter' was the title given to Langton Douglas's article, in May 1903, on Sassetta, and it was subsequently in the same year that Berenson published his two long articles on Sassetta, introducing, amid much else, the Borgo San Sepolcro altar-piece (Fig.8). It seems strange now to read Herbert Cook in i906 writing of the 'partial eclipse' into which had fallen what he rightly called 'one of England's greatest treasures', Titian's Vendramin Family, then known as the 'Cornaro Family' and still in the collection of the Duke of Northumberland. In the Burlington Weale pub- lished the correct date of van Eyck's death - though the painter was called 'John', just as the name 'Tintoret' made its appearance in the Magazine. But the range was always wide, whether facts about Nathaniel Bacon were published or a fresco cycle by Guido Reni. Fry published Bellini's Christ the Redeemer, bought by the Louvre, 'a revelation of the noblest and deepest feelings of Bellini's nature', which he carefully dated to around 1460. Hind wrote on Piranesi and Callot, publishing the British Museum's holdings of Callot's drawings. By 1912 the contributors included Hermann Voss, Borenius, Bernard Rackham, Bredius and G.F. Hill. The range of articles had extended to 'Central African Embroidery' and 'Some Features of Mexican Architecture', as well as pewter, tinder-boxes, lace, drinking-glasses and even 'A Short Study of Windmills'. Eastern and Middle Eastern art, and English furniture, had received detailed, scholarly attention from the start, and some of the most choice of the earliest colour plates illustrate, for example, Persian and Indian carpets in George Salting's collection. The anonymous author of an article in the very first number could refer to the patronage of the reigning Sultan of Turkey 475475continuous tone image\n",

Reproduced April 1909. and his own visit, at the same time as the Kaiser, to the carpet factory at Hereke, while also recalling the 'hawking carpet factory at Hereke, while also recalling the 'hawking of harem treasures in the bazaars of Stamboul during the of harem treasures in the bazaars of Stamboul during the terrible winter of the Russo-Turkish war'. To generalise much about the variety and the approaches embodied in over a decade of articles would be dangerous. There are the definite surprises, like articles on the genius of Bernini, written by Martin Briggs, who thought it necessary to begin by saying 'It is still the custom when writing about Bernini to preface one's criticism with an apology'. Even less foreseen is an early article, by Selwyn Brinton, on Ghislandi. Yet some of the tendencies are too striking to ignore. The reader of today cannot fail to remark that ban- quets of scholarship were then served up with the absolute minimum garnish of footnotes. Certain periods and styles and schools were little written about - perhaps most ob- viously the baroque, though the eighteenth century attracted hardly more attention. Poussin was seldom discussed, and Rubens rarely. There was less than might be supposed on British painting. More generally, 'history' and 'art' did not always flow together quite smoothly. Not much concern was shown for study of subject-matter, or of the social context in which given works had been produced; and questions of patronage and culture and artistic style were perhaps felt to be too broad for the Magazine. It is mildly thought-provoking that Warburg was an exact contemporary of Roger Fry.1 'History' for the Burlington was largely a matter of archival material, emitting little resonance beyond the documentary. Sculpture and architecture tended to be less well covered than painting. Perhaps most fascinating of all is noting what was singled out - and what was neglected - from the art of the century so recently closed. The Magazine had been founded in the lifetime of Cezanne, and, perhaps prudently, had never claimed to deal with much outside 'ancient art'. Nevertheless, and clearly under the guiding hand of Fry, references, illustrations and even occasional articles began to appear which led readers to increasing awareness that art, especially the art of painting, had not died or dwindled into childishness. 'Here', the Magazine stated in 1904, 'it is still the custom to talk as if the so-called Impressionists were at least imperfectly trained if not also imperfectly gifted', going on to refute this view by mention of a painting by Degas (the Ballet scene from 'Robert le Diable'), which had entered national possession with the Ionides bequest to the Victoria & Albert Museum. In 1905 Renoir's La Loge (later to belong to Samuel Courtauld) was reproduced, singled out among the paintings brought to London by Durand-Ruel. In 191o, more provocatively, C6zanne was the subject of an article written by Maurice Denis, translated and introduced by Fry. The point was made of reproducing a number of C6zanne's paintings, 'seeing', Fry wrote, 'how few opportunities English readers have for study of CUzanne's works'. And it was Fry who neatly brought together modern and ancient when he praised in the columns of the Magazine a recent painting by Augustus John, the Woman smiling, by saying 'She might have stepped out of a fresco by Cossa in the Schifanoia palace...' But it is not so much in choice of subjects or attitudes to 'modern' art that the real differences seem to reside between then and now. The underlying approach of so many of the most distinguished contributors of those days seems based on an aestheticism far more disciplined than that of 'The Old Curiosity Shop' at Inverness, indeed fully professional, and sometimes suppressed in the interests of scholarship as then interpreted, yet somehow instinctive. It seems to inform the greatest displays of erudition and to underpin the most factual of articles - as well as, every so often, bursting out unashamedly in a cascade of words unfashionable today and likely now to be derided as irrelevant to the stern task of the true art-historian. And so the threnody - it is no less - that Charles Ricketts composed for the Magazine in 1909, on the death of a gifted fellow-practitioner, Conder, takes on wider application, bid- ding farewell, in effect, to an age as well as to an artist (Fig.9). It is goodbye to the hedonist also, and perhaps to the con- noisseur. Richly allusive in its myriad references, to Beardsley and Byron, Mozart, Veronese and Pater, it culminates in slow, eloquent, mournful celebration of Conder's art, with its sense of luxury and 'the love of beautiful things that pass away, like laughter and music, the mirage of noon, the magic of the night, the perfume of flowers, and youth, and life'. 1A reference to 'my friend Dr A. Warburg, whose name is known to all students of Florentine art', is made by Herbert Horne in THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE, Vol II, June-August 1903, p.386 (a mention I owe to Caroline Elam). 477477continuous tone image]"
