He graduated from the Staatsovergymnasium in Budapest, where he was raised, in 1918. Tolnay was a participant in the famous Budapest <em>Sonntagskreis</em> (Sunday Circle) whose members included intellectuals such as the philosopher Georg Lukíçcs (1885-1971) and art historians <a href=\"/hausera\">Arnold Hauser</a>, <a href=\"/antalf\">Frederick Antal</a>, and <a href=\"/wildej\">Johannes Wilde</a>. Beginning in 1918, Tolnay studied art history and archaeology in Berlin (under <a href=\"/goldschmidta\">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>), in Frankfurt (under <a href=\"/kautzschr\">Rudolf Kautzsch</a>) and Vienna, completing his dissertation in 1925 under the pre-eminent Vienna-School scholar <a href=\"/schlosserj\">Julius Schlosser</a>. His dissertation topic was on Hieronymous Bosch. Methodologically, however, Tolnay was as much influenced by <a href=\"/dvorakm\">Max Dvo»íçk</a>, another of the Vienna scholars. He moved to Rome, researching the topic that would become his life's major focus, Michelangelo. In 1928 he became a privatdozent associated with the University of Hamburg, coming into contact with the young <a href=\"/panofskye\">Erwin Panofsky</a> and writing his habilitation in 1929 on Michelangelo's late architecture. He married Rina Ada Clara Bartolucci in 1930. He received research grants from the Bibliotheca Hertziana for additional study in Rome. Tolnay objected to the Nazi's policies and, although not Jewish himself, he, along with many Jewish art historians, emigrated from Germany. He fled to Paris in 1933 where he worked as the Chargí© de Confí©rences at the Institut d'art et d'archí©ologie of the Sorbonne. Tolnay's 1939 book on the Master of Flí©malle, written in French during this period, established the now accepted notion that this artist is the same as the artist Robert Campin and likely the artist Jacques Daret. With Panofsky's written recommendation on his behalf, he immigrated to the United States in 1939, working at a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ, until 1948. During this time he issued the first of what would become his five-volume analysis on the work of Michelangelo, <u>The Youth of Michelangelo</u>. He become a U.S. citizen as well. After a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1948-1949, he was named a Bollingen Fellow from 1949 until 1953. In 1953 Tolnay was appointed professor at Columbia University. He completed his Michelangelo series in 1960. Tolnay retired from Columbia in 1965 to become Director of the Casa Buonarotti in Florence. As director, he presided over the museum's rescue and restoration of the artworks damaged during the disastrous 1966 flood of the Arno river. He also reorganized the object numbering system and mounted several high-profile exhibitions. Tolnay married second time, to Anna-Marie Reps, a writer and painter, in 1971. During the final years of his life, he began issuing a corpus of Michelangelo drawings, <u>Corpus dei disegni di Michelangelo</u>, the first volume of which appeared in 1975. He died at age 82 in Florence. In 1934, Panofsky wrote that Tolnay was \"one of the most brilliant art historians\" of their time (Wendland). As a connoisseur, Tolnay's attributions convinced the great Berlin scholar <a href=\"/friedlanderm\">Max J. Friedlí_nder</a> that some of Friedlí_nder's own attributions had been wrong. As a modernist, Tolnay he followed the theory of Fí_lep (whom he acknowledged) in an essay on Cí©zanne Tolnay published in Hungarian in 1924, arguing that Cí©zanne's importance was his technique of representing the fragmented world of modernity through his brushstrokes, \"which embodies the essence of form.\" (Lackí_). Tolnay was able to combine two disparate methodologies of his mentors, Goldschmidt and Dvo»íçk, into a cohesive approach, respecting both the object and a theoretical framework on which to place it (Salvini). His major work on Michelangelo was eminently readable, but suffered, according to some, from Tolnay's lack of contact with the original sources. His legacy was continued by the work of <a href=\"/ackermanj\">James Ackerman</a> (Lein).\n",

       "82    Medievalist, wrote important monograph on sculpture at Chartres. Katzenellenbogen (literally, \"cat's elbow\" in German) was the son of the jurist and bank director Albert Katzenellenbogen (1863-1942) and Cornelia Josephine Doctor (1870-1941), both assimilated Jews. His parents, intent on him pursuing a business career, sent him to England to learn the language at an early age. In Frankfurt, he received his <i>Abitur</i> from the Goethe-Gymnasium in 1920. Katzenellenbogen studied Law at Giessen, 1920-1923, receiving his doctor of jurisprudence in 1924. Beginning in 1926, he pursued art history at the newly-established University in Hamburg under the outstanding \"Hamburg school\" art historians <a href=\"/panofskye\">Erwin Panofsky</a>, <a href=\"/saxlf\">Fritz Saxl</a> and to a lesser extent, <a href=\"/tolnayc\">Charles de Tolnay</a>. His dissertation, written under Panofsky, was on medieval iconography. His Ph.D. was granted in 1933. He moved to Konstanz (Constance), Germany, the same year as a private teacher associate with the university, supported by his family. He married the Swiss native Elisabeth Martha Holzheu (1904-1983), in 1935, a pianist. During these years, Katzenellenbogen researched the influence of theology on medieval iconography, findings which would later become his book on medieval allegories. His liberal political affiliations and his \"non-Aryan\" status resulted in his 1938 interning at the Dachau concentration camp. His health seriously declined there. Through the intervention of the Swiss art collector Oskar Reinhart (1885-1965) in Winterthur, he was freed and brought to Switzerland. After convalescence, Katzenellenbogen emigrated to England in 1939. There he published the first of two important monographs on medieval iconography, <u>Allegories of the Virtues and Vices in Medieval Art</u>, under the auspices of the Warburg Institute. He next emigrated to the United States late the same year. Through the assistance of his dissertation advisor, Panofsky, already a professor in the U.S., and New York University professor <a href=\"/cookw\">Walter W. S. Cook</a>, he secured academic positions, beginning with Vassar College as a visiting lecturer in 1940. While in the U.S. he learned his father had perished in the extermination camp at Auschwitz in 1942. In 1943 he was appointed assistant professor at Vassar. Katzenellenbogen published a groundbreaking article on the influence of the Crusades in medieval iconography, \"The Central Tympanum at Ví©zelay: Its Encyclopedic Meaning and Its Relation to the First Crusade,\" in 1944. He became an American Citizen in 1946 and was promoted to associate professor in 1947. Katzenellenbogen was made (full) professor in 1953. With Panofsky he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ. After a visiting professorship at Smith, 1956-1958, he accepted the position as professor of Johns Hopkins University in 1958. The following year he published his important <u>Sculptural Programs of Chartres Cathedral</u>, which won the College Art Association's Charles Rufus Morey award. He was a visiting professor at University of Freiberg in 1963. He died at age 63 after returning from an art conference in Germany. His M.A. students at Hopkins included the Dutch scholar <a href=\"/schwartzg\">Gary Schwartz</a>. Katzenellenbogen was first an iconographer, trained by Panofsky and influenced by the French iconographer <a href=\"/malee\">ímile Mí¢le</a>. A \"true heir to the Warburg [Institute] tradition\" (Bober), he interwove theology and iconography into a blend of art analysis. <a href=\"/stoddardw\">Whitney Stoddard</a> placed Katzenellenbogen in a straight continuum from the \"father of modern [medieval] stylistic analysis,\" <a href=\"/vogew\">Wilhelm Ví_ge</a>, through the patterns-of-stylistic-transmission-theory of <a href=\"/portera\">A. Kingsley Porter</a>, commenting that while both the former writers conclusions had been questioned, Katzenellenbogen's would likely not.\n",

       "114    Warburg Institute and Institute for Advanced Study art historian; major exponent of iconography to American scholars. Panofsky was the son of Arnold Panofsky (d. 1914) and Caecilie Solling (Panofsky), wealthy Jews whose fortune came from Silesian mining. He was raised in Berlin, receiving his <i>Abitur</i> in 1910 at the Joachimsthalsche Gymnasium. He spent the years 1910-1914 studying philosophy, philology and art history in Jura, Berlin (where he heard lectures of the art historian <a href=\"/bieberm\">Margarete Bieber</a>, who was filling in for <a href=\"/loeschckeg\">Georg Loeschcke</a>), and in Munich. While taking courses at Freiburg Universití_t, a slightly older student, <a href=\"/badtk\">Kurt Badt</a>, took Panofsky to hear a lecture by the founder of the art history department, <a href=\"/vogew\">Wilhelm Ví_ge</a>. Panofsky was at once enamored and wrote his dissertation under Ví_ge in 1914. His topic, Dí_rer's artistic theory (<u>Dí_rers Kunsttheorie:  vornehmlich in ihrem Verhaltnis zur Kunsttheorie der Italiener</u>) was  published the following year in Berlin as <u>Die Theoretische Kunstlehre  Albrecht Dí_rers</u>. Because of horse-riding accident, he was exempt from military service during World War I. Instead, he attended the seminars of the medievalist <a href=\"/goldschmidta\">Adolph Goldschmidt</a> in Berlin. He married Dorothea \"Dora\" Mosse (1885-1965), also an art historian from a wealthy family, in 1916. In 1920 his <i>habilitation</i> was accepted in Hamburg on the topic of Michelangelo, the manuscript only rediscovered in 2012. His <i>habilitation</i> in hand, Panofsky was called to chair the art history department of the newly established University of Hamburg in 1920. His first graduate student was <a href=\"/winde\">Edgar Wind</a>.  The decade of the 1920s was one of brilliant writing. In Hamburg, Panofsky formed part of a group of cultural intellectuals. He developed an intimate intellectual circle with <a href=\"/saxlf\">Fritz Saxl</a> with whom he published a 1923 monograph on Dí_rer's <u>Melencholia I</u>, <a href=\"/warburga\">Aby Warburg</a>, and the philosopher and art theorist <a href=\"/cassirere\">Ernst Cassier</a>, centered around Warburg's Institute (see Warburg entry). Panofsky, a \"young, witty, acerbic, conceited genius\" according to one student, <a href=\"/hecksherw\">William Hecksher</a>, developed an immediate student following. Two early papers, \"Der Begriff des Kunstwollens,\" (1920) and \"íìber das Verhaltnis der Kunstgeschichte zur Kunsttheorie,\" (1925) demonstrate Panofsky's theoretical heritage to Cassirer and <a href=\"/riegla\">Aloí¿s Riegl</a>. In 1924, his book <u>Idea</u> was published, a discussion of the ideas of the intellect vis-íæ-vis the imitations of the world of perception. His overt intelligence won him the first full professor of art history at Hamburg (<i>ordentlicher  Professor</i>) in 1926. In 1927 he published <u>Perspektive als  symbolische Form</u>, a dazzling blend of personal theoretics and wide-ranging knowledge of Renaissance art and thought, built around Cassirer's neo-Kantian theories of \"symbolic forms.\" In the academic year 1931-1932, Panofsky paid a visit to the United States representing Warburg's think tank, the Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek Warburg and teaching at New York University.  The Nazis' assumption of power in Germany forced Jews out of academic positions; Panofsky returned to Germany in the summer of 1933 to supervise oral examinations and dissertations for his remaining students before permanently emigrated to the United States in 1934. He published his most famous article, an analysis of the Arnolfini portrait by Jan van Eyck, in the <u>Burlington  Magazine</u> the same year. After a year teacing at New York University, Panofsky became the first permanent professor of the School of Historical Studies of the newly founded Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ, a private research center near Princeton University created so that Jewish scholars (primarily) could work near the University, but not as faculty. Panofsky's move from Hamburg to the United States coincided with a methodological transformation. In Panofsky's early career, he experimented with various approaches to his subject. By the time he had settled in Princeton, he had arrived at the \"conviction that the methodological problems with which he had once grappled had been successfully resolved.\" (Moxey, p. 93). In 1939 Panofsky published <u>Studies in Iconology:  Humanist Themes in the Art of the Renaissance</u>, book which, among other essays, argued for the distinction between <i>iconology</i> and <i>iconography</i>. His 1943 book on Albrecht Dí_rer, combined many of his published ideas on the artist together with a sharp intuitive eye to Dí_rer's prints. Panofsky next issued a primary-source document and commentary on the Abbot Suger and the founding of the Gothic style, <u>Abbot Suger on the Abbey  Church of St.-Denis</u>, in 1946. <u>Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism</u> appeared in 1951, a book about Parisian architectural relationships with the principles of a scholastic <i>summa</i>. His 1947-1948 Charles Eliot Norton lectures at Harvard appeared as the 2-volume monograph on northern Renaissance art, <u>Early Netherlandish Painting</u>, in 1953. It was a detailed iconographical study demonstrating how works of visual realism could incorporate elaborate Christian symbolism convincingly.  Among the book's many revelations was the discovery that the famous Arnolfini double portrait by Jan van Eyck was a wedding document.  <a href=\"/leer\">Rensselaer Lee</a>, chair of the Department of Art and Archaeology at Princeton University from 1956, convinced Panofsky to begin teaching regularly at the University as well. Panofsky's work at the Institute for Advanced Study attracted other art historians to study with him. These included Heckscher in 1936, <a href=\"/grodeckil\">Louis Grodecki</a> in 1951, <a href=\"/gelderj\">Jan van Gelder</a>, 1953, and <a href=\"/delaissel\">Lí©on \"Bob\" Delaissí©</a> in 1959. He presented Gottesman lectures at Uppsala University which appeared in 1960 as the book <u> Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art</u>. The lectures posed the (now) generally accepted notion that smaller \"renaissances\" (re-births) of the classical happened periodically in medieval art and literature before the major one in Italy. He retired from the Institute <i>emeritus</i> in 1963 and was succeeded by <a href=\"/meissm\">Millard Meiss</a>. Panofsky was immediately appointed Samuel Morse Professor of Fine Arts at New York University. His lectures there resulted in the 1964 book <u>Tomb Sculpture</u>. His wife, Dora, died in 1965 and the 73-year-old Panofsky married the 36-year-old art historian Gerda Soergel [Sí_rgel] (b.1929) the following year. Two years later he suffered a series of heart attacks and died. Panofsky's posthumous literary output continued for twenty years. Gerda Panofsky-Soergel continued to update his Abbot Suger book. The six Wrightsman lectures he delivered at the Metropolitan Museum of Art were issued as <u>Problems in  Titian, Mostly Iconographic</u> in 1969. His collected essays appeared in 1995. A son, Wolfgang Panofsky (1919-2007), was a Manhattan-Project physicist and Nobel-Prize winner. Panofsky's many students, in addition to Heckscher and Wind, included <a href=\"/buchthalh\">Hugo Buchthal</a>, <a href=\"/breitenbache\">Edgar Breitenbach</a>, <a href=\"/auerbachi\">Ingeborg Fraenckel Auerbach</a>, <a href=\"/jansonh\">H. W. Janson</a>, <a href=\"/foersterl\">Lotte Brand Philip Foerster</a>, <a href=\"/hoffu\">Ursula Hoff</a>, <a href=\"/kochra\">Robert A. Koch</a>, and <a href=\"/hornw\">Walter W. Horn</a>.  His papers are housed at the Archives of American Art, Washington, DC. In 2012, his habilitation, thought to have been lost was discoverd at the Zentralinstitut fí_r Kunstgeschichte in files of the founding director, <a href=\"/heydenreichl\">Ludwig H. Heydenreich</a> Though Panofsky is considered the \"ur-iconologist,\" his methodology was diverse and is difficult to summarize. Primarily a scholar of medieval and northern Renaissance art, he is most frequently associated with the concept of iconography, matching the subject-matter of works of art to a symbolic syntax of meaning drawn from literature and other art works. His work broadened into a theory of iconology; what <a href=\"/bazing\">Germain Bazin</a> characterized as \"the work of art as a 'symptom'\" (Bazin 217). However, Panofsky was a broad thinker (in the tradition of Cassirer) whose work evolved over a period of time. Another acknowledged debt was to Riegl, the Austrian art historian who espoused the notion of <i>Kunstwollen</i>. Panofsky's notion of perspective as a metaphor in Renaissance art occupied his thinking for an extended period (and resulted in at least one full book). He contended that theories of proportion were generally too elaborate to be applied uniformly to actual works of art. Panofsky's iconology did not preclude a sensitivity for formal considerations or style. The conceptual framework of any period, he wrote, is always subservient to the underlying the style of the art. His use of iconology as the principle tool of art analysis brought him critics. In 1946, van Gelder criticized Panofsky's iconology as putting too much emphasis on the symbolic content of the work of art, neglecting its formal aspects and the work as a unity of form and content. <a href=\"/pachto\">Otto Pí_cht</a>, the Vienna art historian, pointed out in a celebrated book review in 1956 using the case of the van Eyck <u>Arnolfini and his Wife</u> painting, that iconology would elucidate this important work very little. Indeed, Panofsky's conclusions on this double portrait were essentially overturned in 1998 by Lorne Campbell. Panofsky himself had mixed feelings about the success of his method (Cassidy). A scholar who rejoiced in learning and his own mastery, he wrote at times to his medievalist colleagues in Latin (Hourihan).\n",

       "      <td>Marxist/social-history art historian. Antal was born to a wealthy Jewish family. His father, Alajos Antal, was a medical doctor and his mother was Sofia Gerstl. The younger Antal completed a law degree in Budapest and then continued there as well as Freiburg and Paris to study art history. In studied in Berlin under &lt;a href=\"/wolfflinh\"&gt;Heinrich Wí_lfflin&lt;/a&gt; and then in Vienna under &lt;a href=\"/dvorakm\"&gt;Max Dvoríçk&lt;/a&gt;. He received his doctorate in art history in 1914 writing his thesis under Dvo»íçk on neoclassical and Romantic French painting. Antal volunteered in the Print Collection at the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest (1914/1915) cataloging the prints and drawings with &lt;a href=\"/wildej\"&gt;Johannes Wilde&lt;/a&gt;. In 1916 he joined the illustrious discussion group the &lt;em&gt;Sonntagskreis&lt;/em&gt;, whose members included intellectuals such as the philosopher Georg Lukíçcs (1885-1971), the sociologist Karl Mannheim (1893-1947) and art historians &lt;a href=\"/hausera\"&gt;Arnold Hauser&lt;/a&gt; and Wilde. As World War I progressed, the Austro-Hungarian government, under whom he served, assigned him to Udine, Italy, to curate the art in this occupied territory. After the fall of the Empire, and the creation of the Hungarian Soviet Republic (March 21, 1919), Antal became &lt;i&gt;Vorsitzender des Direktoriums&lt;/i&gt; (Chairman of the Board) at the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest, where he assisted in opening the museum's private collection to the public and organizing a successful exhibition with the help of museum director &lt;a href=\"/benescho\"&gt;Otto Benesch&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;i&gt;Vorsitzender&lt;/i&gt; of the museum, Antal headed efforts to promote artists and protect national monuments. His tenure ended abruptly after the Counterrevolution of summer 1919, which forced him to flee first to Florence and then to Vienna. Partially funded by the University of Berlin, Antal traveled extensively in Italy between 1919 and 1923, spending most of his time in Florence. He completed his magnum opus, a history of sixteenth-century Florentine painting in the 1920s, but declined to publish it. He had, in the meantime, become enamored with a Marxist dialectical theory of history, but also, with the realization that any writing about late Italian painting (\"Mannerism\") depended upon a thorough understanding to the fifteenth-century revolution which was the early Renaissance (Blunt). He married Theodora von Lobell (later divorced). The years 1923 to 1933 Antal spent as a resident of Berlin, where he collaborated with Bruno Fí_rst (1891-1965) as editor (1926-1934) of the periodical &lt;u&gt;Kritische Berichte zur kunstgeschichtlichen Literatur&lt;/u&gt;, a publication primarily concerned with methodology. In Berlin his interest was primarily on Italian sixteenth-century painting. In 1932 Antal toured Soviet museums, about which he later lectured (published 1976). The rise of the Nazi regime in Germany in 1933 forced him, as a Jew, to flee again, this time to England, where he was befriended by the art historian &lt;a href=\"/blunta\"&gt;Anthony Blunt&lt;/a&gt;. In 1936 he remarried, now to Evelyn Foster (b. 1903/4), a British citizen, and Oxford graduate. Antal spent his first years in England rewriting his Florentine art history to incorporate his earlier findings and social-history approached. He lectured at the Courtauld Institute and became a naturalized citizen in 1946. Finally, in 1948, his reworked text was published as the book &lt;u&gt;Florentine Painting and its Social Background: the Bourgeois Republic before Cosimo de Medici's Advent to Power: Fourteenth and Early Fifteenth Centuries&lt;/u&gt; in England. His research on drawing at the Royal Library at Windsor Castle, were incorporated into the 1949 catalog by &lt;a href=\"/pophama\"&gt;A. E. Popham&lt;/a&gt; and Wilde. The same year he published \"Remarks on the Method of Art History\" his new-found credo on art-historical method. Thereafter, Antal's interests shifted from French classical/romantic painting to the 18th-century British artists Hogarth and Fí_ssli. He died at his Marlborough Place home in 1954. His manuscripts on Hogarth and Fí_ssli were published posthumously. His collected essays, &lt;u&gt;Classicism and Romanticism, with other Studies in Art History&lt;/u&gt;, published 1966, contained some of his best writing, articles.  Antal's methodology can be seen as blending that of &lt;a href=\"/warburga\"&gt;Aby Warburg&lt;/a&gt; with a more traditional Marxist view of art. In his later writings, he increasingly applied the concept of Marxist dialectical materialism to art history. He suggested that the concept of artistic style is primarily an expression of ideology, political beliefs and social class. This methodology has been criticized as assuming too strong a determination of artistic style by social constructs. Antal was also criticized for defining an artist's identity too narrowly by his patron or benefactor's social class and thereby neglecting the artist's subjectivity. The review of &lt;u&gt;Florentine Painting&lt;/u&gt; by &lt;a href=\"/meissm\"&gt;Millard Meiss&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;u&gt;Art Bulletin&lt;/u&gt; (1949) is most illuminating, both toward Antal's methodology and of the art establishment's reaction of his work. Antal's Marxist beliefs and reputation as politically a Communist effectively excluded from the Western academic world after 1948. His books following &lt;u&gt;Florentine Painting&lt;/u&gt; were less imbued with this methodology. After his death, his social-history Marxist style became more popular and appreciated. The critic and art historian &lt;a href=\"/bergerj\"&gt;John Berger&lt;/a&gt; cited Antal as a major influence on Berger's work and the medievalist &lt;a href=\"/grodeckil\"&gt;Louis Grodecki&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s acknowledged Antal's important study on competing Florentine monastic orders in architectural commissions. Blunt ascribed to Antal one of the earliest art historians to clearly define the term \"Mannerism\" and particularly Fí_ssli's relationship to the earlier movement.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Philosopher of perception and art; used Gestalt psychology for his art-historical studies. Arnheim was the son of Georg Arnheim (1867-1944), a piano factory owner, and Betty Gutherz (Arnheim) (1879-1966). He was raised in Berlin, attending the Herdergymnasium (Abitur 1923). His parents intended him to assume the family business, but beginning in 1923 Arnheim, studied art and music history, philosophy and psychology at the University of Berlin with Gestalt-based scholars Wolfgang Kí_hler (1887-1967) and Kurt Lewin (1890-1947). His Ph.D. dissertation was supervised by the eminent theorist Max Wertheimer (1880-1943) in 1928. Arnheim became friends and was greatly influenced by the private art historian Kurt Badt (q.v.); his sister, Helen \"Leni\" Arnheim (1906-1973) married Badt. Arnheim pursued his interests in the arts through the editorship of &lt;u&gt;Die Weltbuhne&lt;/u&gt;, a leftist magazine of politics and culture, publishing articles on film, art and architecture. This led him to develop his theories of the primacy of perception in art appreciation, linking it with the heretofore separated function of mental cognition. His investigations included music and film (he was one of the first to publish a book on the artistic aspects of the silent film in 1932). He married Annette Siecke (later divorced). While interviewing the Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl (1902-2003) on the radio, she prophetically warned him, \"As long as the Jews are film critics, I'll never have a success.\" Hitler's rise in Germany meant Arnheim had to flee Jewish persecution, initially to Rome. He spent five years as associate editor for a League of Nations cultural publication before Mussolini allied himself with Hitler and Arnheim again had to move. He traveled to England working as a translator for the BBC. In 1940 he immigrated to the United States. He lectured at the New School for Social Research (influencing, among others, the first American Africanist &lt;a href=\"/sieberr\"&gt;Roy Sieber&lt;/a&gt;) and then Columbia University, working as a researcher involved with the habits of radio listeners. Arnheim was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for the 1942-1943 year. He began teaching at Sarah Lawrence College in 1943, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1946. Arnheim married a second time to Mary Frame (1918-1999), a librarian, in 1953. He published his best known work, &lt;u&gt;Art and Visual Perception&lt;/u&gt;, a theory of graphic understanding, in 1954. In 1962, Arnheim wrote a work of true art history, &lt;u&gt;Picasso's Guernica: The Genesis of a Painting&lt;/u&gt;. In it, he traces the elements of the famous Picasso work and how they combine to create the meaning generally accepted today. Arnheim was appointed to Harvard University, Carpenter Center of Visual Arts, in 1968. He retired from Harvard in 1974, emeritus professor of the psychology of art. He continued as a visiting professor at the University of Michigan retiring a second time in 1984. At age 102 he contracted pneumonia at his Ann Arbor retirement community and died. Methodologically, Arnheim was fascinated by the perceptual structures in appreciating art. His investigations in the preliminary sketches for Picasso's Guernica, among other works, helped establish a revised view of art interpretation for many art historians. His pioneering notion of \"Visual thinking,\" the idea that vision itself is the primary modality for thought, is the driving force behind his books. His views on art harken to the empiricist philosophy of John Locke (1632-1704), who asserted that knowledge of the world is an objective sensory experience. Arnheim's view was criticized by, among others, the literary philosopher Richard Rorty (1931-2007) (who ironically died the day before Arnheim).</td>\n",

       "      <td>Artist and art historian. Auerbach grew up in an educated Jewish family in Frankfurt. Her mother was the painter, Emma Kehrmann (1867-1958). She studied art history between 1917-24 at the universities in Frankfurt, Bonn and Munich, under Rudolf Kautzsch (q.v.) and Heinrich Wí_lfflin (q.v.). Her 1925 Frankfurt dissertation, under Kautzsch, focused on 16th-century German portraiture in Franken, Schwaben and Bavaria. She taught at Frankfurter Volksbildungsheim (1925-33). Between 1928-30 she attended classes in painting at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Frankfurt and private classes with Willi Baumeister (1889-1955). As an artist, she exhibited her paintings at various art exhibitions in Germany. In 1933 she emigrated to England where she continued to exhibit her artwork. During World War II, she participated in was service in the Woman's Voluntary Service. When a bomb destroyed her studio, she resolved to return to art history. She lectured at various London colleges (Crosby Hall, Westfield College). Between 1945-49 she resumed study at the Courtauld Institute in London under Sir Henry Hake (1892-1951), the director of the National Portrait Gallery.  She wrote a second Ph.D. dissertation in 1949 on English portraiture and patronage in the 16th century. From 1947-75 she was a visiting lecturer at the Polytechnic Institute in London. In addition, she lectured at the Metropolitan Museum in New York (1970-75) and National Gallery of Art as well as other institutions. She published on Tudor-era portraits and manuscripts in journals such as the &lt;u&gt;Burlington Magazine&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;Apollo&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;The Connoisseur&lt;/u&gt;.

       "      <td>Private scholar; art historian of the baroque and modern periods; methodological theorist. Badt was born to a prosperous Banking family in Berlin. His father, Leopold Badt (1858-1929) raised his children in a rarefied cultural atmosphere, giving them every opportunity to experience art. The younger Badt attended the Berlin-Charlottenburg Reformgymnasium, graduating in 1906. Between 1909-1914 he studied art history and philosophy at the universities of Berlin, Munich and finally at Freiburg (im Breisgau) under &lt;a href=\"/vogew\"&gt;Wilhelm Ví_ge&lt;/a&gt;. While a student, Badt took a young &lt;a href=\"/panofskye\"&gt;Erwin Panofsky&lt;/a&gt; to hear a lecture by Ví_ge and thus cementing one of the most famous pupil/teacher relationships in art history. Badt's doctoral thesis, written in 1914, was on the Renaissance painter Andrea Solario. He never wrote a &lt;i&gt;habilitation&lt;/i&gt; or taught professionally until nearly his retirement. Badt began his career as an assistant at the Bremen Kunsthalle, studying studio painting and sculpture. Throughout his career, his art-historical writing always reflected a painter's interest in details and their relationship to the world. He married Ella C. Wollheim around this time. Badt taught privately at Ludwigshafen/Bodensee, lecturing on the philosophy of G. F. W. Hegel (1770-1831), Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911) and Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), the latter whom he knew personally. His early writings in the 1920s included contemporary artists, such as Wilhelm Lehmbruck. His first marriage dissolved, Badt married Helen \"Leni\" Arnheim (1906-1973), the sister of the esthetician and art historian &lt;a href=\"/arnheimr\"&gt;Rudolf Arnheim&lt;/a&gt;. With the ascension of the Hitler's party in Germany in 1933, Badt moved to Munich in anonymity to avoid Nazi persecution. Although a declared Roman Catholic, Badt's Jewish heritage eventually forced him to flee Nazi Germany at the outbreak of World War II in 1939. He gained a research position at the newly founded Warburg Institute in London, remaining there until after the war. In 1946 he published &lt;u&gt;EugíÂne Delacroix Drawings&lt;/u&gt;, his first book since the partial publication of his thesis in 1914. Badt returned to Germany in 1950 and became a German citizen in 1952, assisting with the reorganization of the university system. The post-war German period of his life resulted in his greatest publishing output. In 1961 Badt issued a series of essays (some previously published) on Jan Vermeer which outlined Badt's methodology '&lt;u&gt;Modell und Maler' von Vermeer&lt;/u&gt;, but also pointedly criticizing the methodology of 'second Vienna school' art historian &lt;a href=\"/sedlmayrh\"&gt;Hans Sedlmayr&lt;/a&gt;. Sedlmayr, perhaps staunchest supporter of Nazism to retain an art history professorship after World War II, argued for a pseudo-scientific theoretic approach to art. Ever rooted in the object, Badt's &lt;u&gt;Vermeer&lt;/u&gt; attacked Sedlmayr on methodological grounds. In 1968 he was invited by literary theorist Hans Robert Jauss (1921-1997) to the newly founded University of Constance (Konstanz). Badt's work greatly influenced the art historians Gertrude Berthold (b. 1920), the Sedlmayr student &lt;a href=\"/dittmannl\"&gt;Lorenz Dittmann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/gosebruchm\"&gt;Martin Gosebruch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/grossw\"&gt;Werner Gross&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/schmollj\"&gt;Josef Adolf Schmoll &lt;em&gt;genannt&lt;/em&gt; Eisenwerth &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=\"/imdahlm\"&gt;Max Imdahl&lt;/a&gt;. Despondent in old age, Badt committed suicide at 83. Badt regarded art as a portrait of reality (&lt;i&gt;Wirklichkeitsdarstellung)&lt;/i&gt;. Of particular interest to him was the subject matter of the work and meaning of colors in paintings. This method lent itself best to the artists he studied: Nicolas Poussin, Jan Vermeer, John Constable, EugíÂne Delacroix, Paul Cí©zanne, Vincent van Gogh and Paolo Veronese. Badt considered the \"masterpiece\" to be the only art worth studying. Among his appreciators, Jauss, (1975) praised him for mentioning human suffering in his works, often forgotten by other historical works. W. Eugene Kleinbauer characterized him as \"too rigid for analysis.\" Badt's art history owes much to Johann Gustav Droysen's &lt;u&gt;  Historik&lt;/u&gt; (1868). Badt wrote about the distinction between art history and its political, social and economic implications. He questioned deeply rooted principles of art history as had Heinrich Wí_lfflin (q.v). Since he was writing against the norm, other art historians often portrayed as a traitor and his understanding of art was questioned. His writings and methodology sparked greatest interest in fields outside art history.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Expert in the German Art of the Middles Ages. Baum studied art history at the universities of Munich, Berlin and Tí_bingen, where he worked under Karl Voll (q.v.) and Heinrich Wí_lfflin (q.v). He completed his dissertation in Tí_bingen in 1905 on the churches of the architect Heinrich Schickhardt (1558-1634) under Konrad Lange (q.v.). Baum wrote his habilitation under Heinrich Weizsí_cker (q.v.) in Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart. In 1911 his work on &lt;u&gt;Ulmer Plastik um 1500&lt;/u&gt;, caught the attention of the scholars Paul Clemen (q.v), Jakob Ritter von Falke (q.v) and Philipp Halm (1854-1923) at the Technische Hochschule. He taught art history there until 1924. Except for voluntary service in World War I, Baum worked between 1908-23 first as an assistant and then conservator at the Wurtemberg Office for Historic Conservation (Wí_rttembergischen Amt fí_r Denkmalpflege) and at the state museum in Stuttgart. Out of this work he published the catalog &lt;u&gt;Deutschen Bildwerke des 10.-18. Jahrhunderts&lt;/u&gt; (1931). In 1924 Baum was called to be the director of the museum at Ulm. There he dedicated himself to the history of local art and artists. He married Emma Gruner (1893-1970), a protestant woman, in 1929. In 1930 he published the final volume in the series of &lt;u&gt;Handbuchs des Kunstwissenschaft,&lt;/u&gt; which was the first survey of the history of paintings and sculpture of the north Alps in the Middle Ages. After his dismissal in 1933 he was invited by Johnny Roosval (q.v.) of the University of Stockholm to lecture in the Winter semester of 1935. His lectures were published in 1937 in Paris as &lt;u&gt;La sculpture figurale en Europe íæ l'í©poque mí©rovingienne&lt;/u&gt;. Back in Stuttgart as a private art historian, Baum was arrested by the Gestapo in 1938 as a Jew and taken to the concentration camp at Welzheim. Authorities at a museum in Bern rescued him in 1939, enabling a move to Switzerland. He lived in Switzerland until the end of World War II working for the state archive in Lucerne researching medieval sculptors. In 1946 Baum returned to Germany at the invitation of the minister of culture Theodor Heuss (1884-1963). Baum was enlisted in the rebuilding of German castles between 1947-1952.  In his research on medieval Bavarian art, Bauch analyzed the development of styles and iconography of the Middle Ages. Baum understood style questions as matters of time, dissociated from at the trend toward a \"scientific approach to art\" which became vogue in the 1920s (led by Kurt Gerstenberg (q.v), Wilhelm Pinder (q.v), Oskar Hagen (q.v), Eugen Kurt Fischer) which related artistic epochs to among other things, ethnic peoples. Chief among these in the speculation was the gothic, which Baum regarded as an element of the era, not of a people. Typical of the form-analytic generation of art historians, Baum, saw the development of art in the context of the culture and history of ideas, a notion he adopted from Jakob Burckhardt (q.v.). In &lt;u&gt;Zwí_lf deutsche Dome des Mittelalters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;(1955) he examined individual buildings and their sculptural decoration in the context of their respective social conditions in the cities and dioceses. The self-sufficiency of the German buildings were stressed, contrasting French and Italian reliance on the antique. The wall treatment became a key notion for Baum.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Rembrandt scholar and director of the Albertina 1947-61. Benesch's father was the art collector Heinrich Benesch (q.v.). Among the elder Benesch's friends was the Austrian Expressionist Egon Schiele. A double portrait of father and son, painted by Schiele in 1913, is owned by the Wolfgang-Gurlitt-Museum in Linz, Austria. The younger Benesch studied art history at the University of Vienna and a semester in Stockholm under Johnny Roosval (q.v.). Around 1919 he assisted Friedrick Antal (q.v.) in organizing the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest. Benesch wrote his dissertation in Vienna under Max Dvo»íçk in 1921 on the subject of Rembrandt's drawings. Between 1919-23 he was a volunteer assistant at the picture gallery (Gemí_ldegalerie) at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, under director of Gustav Glí_ck (q.v.). In 1923 he was appointed assistant curator at the Graphische Sammlung Albertina. There he met Eva Steiner, an administrative clerk, and married her in 1934. In 1935 he wrote the twelve-page (!) entry on Rembrandt for the &lt;u&gt;Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden Kí_nstler&lt;/u&gt; (Thieme-Becker). With the annexation of Austria by the Nazis in 1938, the Benesches fled (Eva, although protestant, was of Jewish extraction). Traveling by way of Switzerland, Benesch moved to France and then, in 1939, was a guest lecturer in the Netherlands. The academic year 1939-40 he spent in England, where he was briefly interned on the Isle of Man at the outbreak of World War II. At the invitation of Walter W. S. Cook (q.v.), Benesch lectured at New York University, and in 1941 at Harvard University with the assistance of a Guggenheim Fellowship supplied by Wilhelm Koehler (q.v.). During the war he and Eva worked for the American Defense, Harvard Group, identifying art monuments in Austria and Czechoslovakia. In 1945 he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. It was in 1945 that he first published his &lt;u&gt;The Art of the Renaissance in Northern Europe&lt;/u&gt;. The book owes much to Dvo»íçk, especially the expansion of the Dvo»íçkian concept of Mannerism to northern artists such as Bruegel (Posner). In 1946 he was called back to Vienna, where he assumed the Director of the Albertina in 1947, a position he held until 1962. He was named Associate Professor of Art History at the University of Vienna in 1948. His years as director focused on acquisitions that broadened the scope of the Albertina's collections. Between 1954-57 Benesch published the first complete catalog of Rembrandt drawings, based on much original research. Benesch's area of scholarship was graphic arts and particularly Rembrandt.  His publications reflect his wide interests, covering gothic art, conservation of monuments, art theory and musicology (he was an organist and keyboard musician). Methodologically, Benesch was not wedded to theory, such as fellow Vienna-school historians Otto Pí_cht (q.v.), Dagobert Frey (q.v.) and Hans Sedlmayr (q.v.). Instead, he employed the &lt;i&gt;Geistesgeschichte&lt;/i&gt; approach of documentary/intellectual history akin to the work of his mentor Dvo»íçk. He and Hans Tietze (q.v.) were among Dvo»íçk's most important pupils.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Modernist art historian and art librarian, professor University of Kansas. Berger studied art history under Heinrich Wí_lfflin (q.v.), Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.), Graf Vitzthum von Eckstí_dt (q.v.) and Paul Frankl (q.v.) at the respective universities of Munich, Berlin, Heidelberg and Gí_ttingen. He completed his dissertation under Moritz Geiger in aesthetics at Gí_ttingen in 1925, his topic addressing Wí_lfflin's methodology. From 1926-28 was an assistant and one of the earliest collaborators at the Warburg Library in Hamburg, under Fritz Saxl (q.v.). He was a lecturer on art at the University of Berlin Extension, Berlin, between 1927-33 and head librarian at the Berlin Municipal Libraries, Berlin, 1929-1933. With the advent of the Nazi party's authority in 1933, Berger was forced to flee Germany, not because of religion (he was from a protestant family) but because of his profile in the Social Democratic party. He went first to France were he worked as a library assistant at the BibliothíÂque Nationale, lecturing on art (1936-1939) at an independent German-speaking school there. Just before the Nazi invasion of France, he secured an emergency visa to the United States, emigrating in 1941. He taught at Northwestern University as a lecturer on art, 1943-1945. As the war was winding down in Europe, Berger joined the U.S. Army University and returned to France at Biarritz, as a professor of art in 1945. He switched to the U.S. Military Government of Bavaria (OMGUS), where, as an officer, he worked in the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Section for 1946. After war service he joined the University of Kansas City (now the University of Missouri at Kansas City), as an assistant professor of art (1947-1950) moving to the University of Kansas, Lawrence in 1950 as an assistant professor, eventually rising to professor of art history. He retired in 1970 and resettled in France.Berger's 1952 book on Gí©ricault, the first modern biography of the artist, demonstrates Berger's methodology as an art historian. Downplaying the dominant view of Gí©ricault as motivated by the Romantic movement, Berger emphasized the artist's political commitment. His quasi-Marxist approach, one reviewer remarked, follows that of Frederick Antal (q.v.). Indeed, Berger's brother was a prominent communist in pre-war Germany. Berger's interest was on reinterpreting the artist, rather than a discovery of new documents. The popularity of his approach--Berger employed Freudian analysis for a number of pictures--is demonstrated by the book's rapid translation into both French and English. However, Berger's emphasis on reinterpretation was at the cost of scrutiny of the original work. In a caustic reply to the Germain Seligman (q.v.) review of Berger's book in the &lt;u&gt;Art Bulletin&lt;/u&gt;, Lorenz Eitner (q.v.) took Berger to task for accepting works as autograph which even then were suspect. The fact that Berger validated a painting in Seligman's gallery only added to the apparent impropriety.</td>\n",

Berliner's parents were Theodor Berliner, a protestant from Jewish extraction, who owned a factory, and Philippine Wollner (Berliner). Beginning in 1904, Berliner studied art history in Berlin, Heidelberg and Vienna under &lt;a href=\"/dvorakm\"&gt;Max Dvo»íçk&lt;/a&gt;, earning his doctorate in 1910 with a dissertation on the dating of a Greek manuscript miniature painting. He joined the Bavarian National Museum (Bayerischen Nationalmuseum) in Munich in 1912, working there until 1935 except for War service (1914-1918). He was chief curator at the museum from 1926. In 1933 Berliner, because of his Jewish heritage, was interned in the concentration camp in Dachau, but released after two years later through the initiative of two of his colleagues, the art historian Hans Buchheit (1878-?) and collector Eugen Brí_schwiler. He was nonetheless dismissed from the Museum on \"racial\" grounds, accusations of which he had previously escaped during the initial 1933 purge because of his extensive war service. Between 1935-1939, he lived in the Alps near Berchtesgaden, until he was finally forced to emigrate. In the United States, Berliner worked at the Museum of Arts of Decoration of Cooper Union (1939-1946), the Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Fine Arts (1946-1953), and at the Textile Museum in Washington DC from 1962 until his re-emigration to Germany in 1967. In the 1950s, Berliner taught the museum course at NYU's Institute of Fine Arts. Berliner was an authority on textile arts and ivory but also wrote on Christian iconography (notably representations of creches) and the 18th century Giuseppe Barberi (1746-1809). &lt;a href=\"/ettinghausenr\"&gt;Richard Ettinghausen&lt;/a&gt;, in his introduction to Berliner's bibliography, notes that Berliner did not limit himself to \"great\" topics of art history but rather concerned himself with facts, fighting all superficial interpretation, turning his attention to the marginal and to everyday objects often considered only &lt;i&gt;curiosa&lt;/i&gt; by established art historians. A strong personality, he remained respected by the academic community for the novel insights which his scholarship provided.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Medievalist art historian and professor; wrote on phenomenology. Bernheimer was born into a prominent family of art dealers, &lt;i&gt;Bernheimer of Munich&lt;/i&gt;. In the early 20th century, the firm was one of the most important dealerships in precious materials, antiquities, Gobelins and oriental carpets. Between 1925-30, Bernheimer studied art history (both Western and Oriental) as well as archeology in Munich, Berlin and Rome with Wilhelm Pinder (q.v.), Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.), August Liebmann Mayer (q.v.), Hans Kauffmann (q.v.), Werner Weisbach (q.v.) and Hans Hildebrandt (q.v.). His dissertation, written under Pinder, was on Roman animal sculpture and its originating motives. Between the time of graduation and the Nazi assumption of power in 1933, he apparently taught privately and worked in the family business. Of Jewish extraction, Bernheimer was forced to flee Germany in 1933, securing a position at The University of Pennsylvania teaching undergraduates. Between 1933 and 1958 was respectively lecturer, Assistant Professor, and Associate Professor (1942) at Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges, also serving in the US army during the World War II. In 1951 he was appointed full professor. He spent the year 1941 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He committed suicide in Portugal at age 50. His son, Charles Bernheimer (1942-1998), was a noted scholar of Comparative Literature and Multicultural Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. Bernheimer's life interest was in Oriental influences on the west, but his publications were wide ranging. His most important book, &lt;u&gt;Wild Men in  the Middle Ages&lt;/u&gt; (1952), reflects his willingness to delve deeply into folklore and history to write a highly original and respected book. Known as well for an interest in mathematics, music and theology, &lt;u&gt;Wild Men&lt;/u&gt; looked at fertility rites involving the staged capture of \"wild men\" in medieval Europe. His research allowed him to come up with compelling interpretations of beasts in medieval and reniassance art that had puzzled other scholars such as Erwin Panofsky (q.v.). An enthusiastic teacher, his positive lecturing style was noted by many of his students.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Riemenschneider scholar, professor and director of the North Carolina Museum of Art. Bier grew up in a wealthy Nuremberg family. He attended the Humanistisches Gymnasium in that city. After graduation in 1917, he fought in the first World War 1917-18. Between 1919 and 1924 Bier studied art history, archaeology, and medieval and modern history at the universities in Munich, Erlangen, Jena, Bonn and finally Zí_rich. His major professors were Paul Clemen (q.v.) and Heinrich Wí_lfflin (q.v.). His dissertation, written under Wí_lfflin, was on the early work of his home town's most famous artist, Tilman Riemenschneider. It was granted in 1924 and published the following year. Between 1924-1930 Bier he began publishing his magisterial book on Riemenschneider while lecturing (Dozent) at the Volkschule. He also contributed articles on modern architecture. In 1931 he married the art historian Senta Dietzel (1900-1978), whose brother was the gallery owner Max Dietzel, a sponsor of the Kí_nstlergruppe Brí_cke shows and other modern art. From 1930-36 Bier was a curator of the Kestner Society and Museum in Hannover which mounted contemporary art exhibitions. Bier himself collected the work of Bauhaus artists Paul Klee, Oskar Schlemmer and Lyonel Feininger. In 1936 the Nazi government closed the Kestner Society and banished Bier, who was Jewish. Bier withdrew first to upper Bavaria and then, in 1937 immigrated to the United States. His former classmate, Richard Krautheimer (q.v.) recommended Bier for the position he was vacating at the University of Louisville, Kentucky. Bier taught art history there 1937-60, acting as Chair of the department 1946-60. While Chair at Louisville, he founded the Allen R. Hite Institute. He was a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, during the year 1953-54, and visiting professor at the Freie Universití_t, Berlin in 1956 and a Fulbright lecturer in Wí_rzburg, 1960-61. He supplied over two hundred pieces of art criticism for the Louisville &lt;u&gt;Courier Journal&lt;/u&gt;. In 1960, Bier was appointed to be the second director of the state art museum in North Carolina, replacing the late Wilhelm Valentiner (q.v.). He functioned as director of the North Carolina Museum of art until his retirement in 1970. His papers are housed at the University of Louisville where an endowed chair is named for him. Bier was a connoisseur-scholar who's research focused principally on gothic and renaissance architecture and sculpture.  He was an exponent of modern art and architecture and was friends with many Bauhaus architects (including Mies van der Rohe).</td>\n",

After attending the Lyceum in Hamburg, 1909-1913 and receiving an &lt;i&gt;abitur&lt;/i&gt; from the Heinrich-Hertz Realgymnasium in 1916, she attended the universities of Munich and then Hamburg concentrating in philosophy. Her dissertation, written under Ernst Cassirer (q.v.) in 1921, focused on Lessing and Leibniz. The following year she began working as a librarian at the Warburg Library (Kulturwissenschaflichen Bibliothek Warburg or \"KBW\"), founded by Aby Warburg (q.v.), who was then hospitalized for a mental condition. She would be associated with various aspects of the Warburg the rest of her life. In 1924 Bing became Warburg's personal research assistant. Together with Fritz Saxl (q.v.) the three became the Warburg Institute of those early years. The KBW officially opened in 1926. She effectively became the director in 1927. At Warburg's death in 1929, Bing edited his &lt;u&gt;Gesammelten Schriften&lt;/u&gt;. With the Nazi rise to power in 1933, the KBW, founded by and named for a Jew, fell from official favor. Together with Saxl, who was now Bing's life partner, the two moved the KBW to London as the Warburg Institute. The Institute was headed by Saxl with assistance and lecturing by Henri Frankfort (q.v.), with Bing as assistant Director. Saxl and Bing worked tirelessly to sponsor and find jobs for art historians fleeing Nazi Germany. At the beginning of World War II, Bing drove an ambulance in Britain as part of t he London Auxilliary Ambulance Service until she was dismissed as an \"enemy alien.\" Saxl and Bing's home in Dulwich was open to many scholars throughout their career, including the young art historian couple from New York University, Harry Bober (q.v.) and Phyllis Pray Bober (q.v.). In 1948 Saxl died and was succeed as director by Frankfort. Bing succeeded Frankfort at his death in 1954, lecturing at the University of London as the Professor of the History of the Classical Tradition. Bing fell ill while working at the Institute in 1964 and died a month later.</td>\n",

Born's parents were Gustav Born (1850-1900), a professor of anatomy and embryology at the University in Breslau, and Berthe Lipstein (Born). Born served in World War I in the sanitary corps. After the war he married Susi Bial in 1918 studying studio art at schools between 1919-1923 in Munich and under ídouard Vuillard in Paris. As an artist, Born issued a series of lithographs in 1921 to illustrate the 1912 novella &lt;u&gt;Der Tod in Venedig&lt;/u&gt; (Death in Venice) by Thomas Mann (1875-1955). Mann so approved of the art that he wrote Born, revealing for the first time that the protagonist was drawn from the composer Gustav Mahler (1860-1911). Born moved to Vienna the same year, divorcing Bial in 1925. In Vienna he worked as a free-lance journalist, book illustrator, radio art critic and extension professor at the Volkshochschule. He turned to art history in 1928, attending classes at the universities of Munich, under &lt;a href=\"/wolfflinh\"&gt;Heinrich Wí_lfflin&lt;/a&gt; and Vienna under &lt;a href=\"/strzygowski\"&gt;Josef Stryzgowski&lt;/a&gt;. Born wrote his dissertation under Strzygowski in 1931 on the topic of animal representation in interlace design of illustrated books. He worked briefly as an expertizer at the Dorotheum in Vienna, but the rise of the Nazis in Germany in 1933 prevented further publishing there (though Roman Catholic, he was of Jewish extraction). Shortly before the annexation of Austria by the Third Reich, Born emigrated to the United States in 1937 to avoid persecution. In the United States he secured a job as Art Director at Maryville College, St. Louis, MO, teaching art and art history. He became a U.S. citizen in 1943. The following year he moved to New York, taking a position at Queens College, New York, then professor of Art History at Louisiana State University, New Orleans, 1945-1948. Born wrote the obituary for Wí_lfflin in the &lt;u&gt;College Art Journal&lt;/u&gt; in 1945. In Louisiana Born married a second time to Mary Mercer in 1946. He returned to New York in 1948 as professor of art history at Hunter College (City University of New York). The same year Born published &lt;u&gt;American Landscape Painting; an Interpretation&lt;/u&gt;, which brought to the attention of the American reading public the importance of American art (Wickiser). He suffered a heart attack and died in 1949. Born's half brother (through his father's first marriage) was the Nobel-prize-winning physicist Max Born (1882-1970). Born's publications were largely journal articles, ranging from the scholarly to the non-art publications. From Strzygowski, he drew an appreciation of psychological aspects of art, publishing articles in art in several psychology journals. He had begun to publish monographs in his new-found area of American art at the time of his death.</td>\n",

       "      <td>University of Toronto professor and early Courtauld Institute scholar. Brieger was born to Oskar Brieger, (d. 1914), an otolaryngologist and Hedwig Lion. He grew up in this affluent family under the tutelage of a governess, surrounded by books, and a summer home where his father had built a home theater for family drama productions. Their furniture was designed by Hans Poelzig (now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge University). As a child, he attended the St. Maria Magdalena Gymnasium. After receiving his &lt;i&gt; abiture&lt;/i&gt; in 1916, he fought for Germany in World War I where he was wounded in Flanders. After the armistice in 1919, Brieger studied various humanistic disciplines at the universities in Breslau and Munich. He finally settled up on art history, studying under Wilhelm Pinder (q.v.) and, more significantly for him, Paul Frankl (q.v.) and Heinrich Wí_lfflin (q.v.). Between 1922-1927 he was an assistant under August Grisebach (q.v.) at Breslau. He received his Ph.D. in art history in 1924, writing a dissertation under Grisebach on Baroque art. It was partially published in 1926. Between 1927-1928 he researched at the Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rome. He became a &lt;i&gt;privatdozent&lt;/i&gt; at Breslau under Grisebach, writing his habilitation on 19th-century history painting in Germany in 1927 (published in Berlin in 1930). Brieger continued as a&lt;i&gt; privatdozent&lt;/i&gt; under Dagobert Frey (q.v.) between 1930 and1933. In 1931 he married Barbara Ritter, an historian. In 1933, anticipating the Jewish persecution in Nazi-Germany, Brieger left for Paris. He was officially classified a \"non-Aryan\" by the Nazi government (his family came from Jewish lineage) in 1934, when he finally fled to London. There, he secured work on the &lt;u&gt;Atlas of Medieval Art and Architecture in England&lt;/u&gt;, being produced at the Courtauld Institute. The Institute conducted classes largely with temporary appointment faculty, of whom Brieger was one. His years in London turned his attention toward English medieval art, and he remained a medievalist for the rest of his career. In 1936 he moved to Canada seeking permanent employment. There he taught art history at the University of Toronto, rising through the ranks: lecturer and then associate professor, finally professor in 1947. In 1957 he wrote the volume &lt;u&gt;English Art, 1216-1307&lt;/u&gt; for the &lt;u&gt;Oxford History of English Art&lt;/u&gt;, edited by Thomas Boase (q.v.). He chaired the department between 1965 and 1969. Brieger was a visiting member at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ for the 1964-1965 year. After retirement in 1969 he edited a facsimile edition with Millard Meiss (q.v.) and Charles S. Singleton (1909-1985) on Dante manuscripts. He was a part-time professor at the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies in Toronto until 1973. He contributed to the National Gallery of Canada exhibition, \"Art and the Courts: France and England from 1259 to 1328\" in 1972.Brieger is considered \"a pioneer in Art History as an academic discipline in Canada\" (Eleen).</td>\n",

Plans for the museum were formulated from 1873 to 1875 thorugh a design of Carl Johann Christian Zimmermann. The Museum was opened in 1877, located on Steintorplatz, officially known as the Staatliches Technikum und Museum fí_r Kunst und Gewerbe (State Center for Technology and Msueum of Fine and Useful Arts). Brinckmann collected a wide range of objects for the museum, from Renaissance painting to Viennese furniture to Japanese prints. He lectured publicly on the collection. Beginning in 1878, one person in Brinckmann's audience was the young &lt;a href=\"/lichtwarka\"&gt;Alfred Lichtwark&lt;/a&gt;. The two became friends with Brinckmann introducing Lichtwark to the Hamburg industrials Carl Kall, who funded Lichtwark's later studies in art history. The young Otto Kí_mmel, later director of the Berlin Museums, volunteered under Brinckmann in 1902-1904. After Brinckmann's death,&lt;a href=\"/sauerlandtm\"&gt; Max Sauerlandt&lt;/a&gt; succeeded him as director in 1919. The Justus Brinckmann Gesellschaft, Hamburg, is named in his honor. His lectures (along with those of Lichtwark) inspired the modernist art historian &lt;a href=\"/schapirer\"&gt;Rosa Schapire&lt;/a&gt; to become an art historian. Kultermann sites Brinckmann among those &lt;i&gt;Grí_nderzeit&lt;/i&gt; museum directors, along with &lt;a href=\"/bodew\"&gt;Wilhelm von Bode&lt;/a&gt;, Lichtwark, &lt;a href=\"/seidlitzw\"&gt;Woldemar von Seidlitz&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"/woermannk\"&gt;Karl Woermann&lt;/a&gt;, as responsible for the formation of art history by virtue of their scholarship and interest in museum training.

The family lived in the \"Villa Buchthal\" on Berlin's west end (after the war, the home of tenor Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, b. 1925). Buchthal attended the Herder-Reform-Gymnasium in Charlottenberg, graduating in 1927. After a semester studying economics, he switched to art history, attending classes at the universities including the Sorbonne, Paris, Heidelberg and Berlin before settling on the so-called new \"Hamburg school\" art historians Fritz Saxl (q.v.), Edgar Wind (q.v.) and Erwin Panofsky (q.v.) and the concomitant Warburg Institute, then directed by Saxl. The accession of power in Germany by the Nazis in 1933 meant that all Jewish university faculty were being summarily discharged. Saxl warned Buchthal that if he could not finish his dissertation by the end of 1933, he would be forced to leave the Warburg without a degree, as the Institute was closing its doors. Panofsky was already living in New York as a visiting professor, but returned briefly to Hamburg that summer for his students oral examinations and dissertations. Buchthal finished his dissertation in the two summer weeks for Panofsky to grant the degree, writing on the Codex Pariinus Graecus 139. He emigrated in 1934 for \"racial reasons\" (he was Jewish) to London with the Warburg Institute staff and library. The Warburg in London became a center for German refugee scholars like Buchthal, including, among others Ernst Gombrich (q.v.) and Wind. In 1935 he studied Arabic at the School of Oriental and African Studies before receiving a fellowship from 1936 to 1937 at the University of Beirut. He was the 1938 Lord Plumer Fellow at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. That same year he also re-edited and published his dissertation, &lt;u&gt;The Illustrations of the Paris Psalter: a Study in Middle Byzantine Painting&lt;/u&gt; (1938). In 1939 her married Amalia \"Maltschi\" Serkin (1904-1996), sister of the pianist Rudolf Serkin (1903-1991). The Warburg Institute was evacuated to Denham, England, at the outbreak of World War II. Buchthal acted as librarian for the Institute during 1941-43, becoming a Lecturer a the University of London 1944-45 (which subsumed the Institute). He was a visiting fellow at Dumbarton Oaks 1950-51 and again in 1965. In 1957 he published perhaps his most influential book, &lt;u&gt; Miniature Painting in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem&lt;/u&gt;. Buchthal was the first to organize the illuminated manuscripts produced in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, from the twelfth-century Melisende Psalter to the later manuscripts written in Acre, into a cohesive body for discussion. His book remains a detailed introduction to the manuscripts and a comprehensive study of Crusader miniature painting. In 1959-60 Buchtal was appointed a temporary member at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ. The years 1960-65 Buchthal was an endowed chair at the Warburg Institute with the year 1963 as a visiting professor at Columbia University, New York. Between 1965-75 he was the first Ailsa Mellon Bruce Chair in Fine Arts at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1970 and 1971. The1970s were a period of great publishing activity for Buchthal. His books include works on both French and Italian manuscripts of the legend of the fall of Troy, &lt;u&gt;Historia Troiana&lt;/u&gt; (1971), and later Byzantine painting, &lt;u&gt;Patronage in Thirteenth-century Constantinople&lt;/u&gt;, with Hans Belting (q.v.), (1978). From 1975 onward he was a professor emeritus at New York University. Buchthal's students at the Warburg included Michael Kauffmann (q.v.), who would later become its director. His Institute of Fine Arts students included Harvey Stahl (q.v.). Buchthal died of a heart ailment at age 87; his wife, Amalia, died less than a week later. Buchthal's area was Byzantine and western medieval art. His 1957 &lt;u&gt; Miniature Painting in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem&lt;/u&gt; (1957) was praised for weaving paleographic and liturgical analysis with meticulous visual skill. Buchthal was particularly interested in the transfers of traditions and culture between the medieval east and west. He is credited for opening the area of Crusader culture as an area for art historical study. Thomas F. Mathews (q.v.), a former student, described Buchthal's writings as laying \"the foundation for all subsequent work on the art of the Crusaders.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Peter Paul Rubens scholar. Burchard's father was an apothecary in Mainz, Georg Burchard. Burchard himself attended the Grossherzogliches Gymnasium in Karlsruhe, graduating in 1904. He studied at the universities of Munich, Heidelberg and Halle-Wittenberg. During this time he volunteered at the print room in Dresden and Berlin where he earned the praise of director &lt;a href=\"/bodew\"&gt;Wilhem von Bode&lt;/a&gt;. Burchard served in the German army in World War I in field artillery. His 1917 dissertation was written at Halle under &lt;a href=\"/goldschmidta\"&gt;Adolph Goldschmidt&lt;/a&gt; on Rembrandt etchings. He married Lily Stange in 1919. In the 1920s he was editor of the &lt;u&gt; Allgemeines K&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;í_nstler-Lexikon&lt;/u&gt; founded by &lt;a href=\"/thiemeu\"&gt;Ulrich Thieme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/beckerf\"&gt;Felix Becker&lt;/a&gt;, (\"Thieme-Becker\") in Leipzig. He was also on the staff of the periodical &lt;u&gt;Kunstchronik&lt;/u&gt;. Burchard moved to Berlin as the editor of &lt;u&gt;Zeitschrift f&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;í_r bildenden Kunst&lt;/u&gt;, 1921-22. In 1921, too, he completed the volume on Rubens in the &lt;u&gt;Klassiker der Kunst&lt;/u&gt; series left undone by the premature death of &lt;a href=\"/oldenbourgr\"&gt;Rudolf Oldenbourg&lt;/a&gt;. It was at this time that he envisioned a new &lt;i&gt;catalogue raisonn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;í©&lt;/i&gt; of Rubens' work, the task of which would be his life's assignment. A brief article on Cornelis van Dalem in the &lt;u&gt;Jahrbuch des Preussischen Kunstsammlung&lt;/u&gt; in 1924 establish the importance of that little-known master. One of his assistants during this time was the young art historian and later important modernist &lt;a href=\"/wescherh\"&gt;Hertha Wescher&lt;/a&gt;. The ascension to power of the Nazi's in 1933 meant trouble for Burchard, who, though nominally protestant, had a Jewish mother. He emigrated to London in 1935, settling outside the city with his then large archive of Rubens material. Burchard took in other emingres to work on his project, including &lt;a href=\"/grossmannf\"&gt;Fritz Grossmann&lt;/a&gt;. In 1939 Burchard published a prospectus of his upcoming catalog, &lt;u&gt;The Work of Peter Paul Rubens&lt;/u&gt;, then projected for six volumes. The outbreak of World War II halted his publishing plans, however. In England, Burchard was intern briefly in 1940. After the war, many Rubens paintings appeared on the market and others, still, required cleaning and re-examination after their hiding in bomb shelters. Thus the critical catalog project was once again delayed. In 1955 Burchard conducted seminar on Rubens for the annual summer \"Belgian Art Seminar\" which had been established in 1951 by Herman Liebaers, Director of the Royal Library of Belgium. The following year Burchard expanded this to a Rubenshius exhibition of Rubens drawings, celebrating Burchard's 75th birthday. The exhibition catalog, co-written with &lt;a href=\"/hulstr\"&gt;Roger d'Hulst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"/dhulstr\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was expanded in 1963 and remains one of the most important monographs on the topic. Burchard frequented the major auction houses and provided many written opinions to them. At Burchard's death, his papers were acquired by the Kunsthistorische Musea by &lt;a href=\"/baudouinf\"&gt;Frans Baudouin&lt;/a&gt; principally to edit the core of the Rubenianum, a documentation center for the study of Rubens and 16th- and 17th-century Flemish art. It is housed in the Kolveniersstraat in Antwerp. One stipulation of the donation was that a &lt;i&gt;catalogue raison&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;í©&lt;/i&gt; on Rubens should be published based on Burchard's materials. The city of Antwerp made an agreement with Burchard's heirs and the Nationaal Centrum voor de Plastische Kunsten van de 16de en de 17de Eeuw (today the Centrum voor de Vlaamse kunst van de 16de en 17de eeuw), chaired by d'Hulst, to edit and produce the set, known as the &lt;u&gt;Corpus Rubenianum Ludwig Burchard&lt;/u&gt;. Burchard was criticized during his lifetime and after for having withheld much of the material he collected or controlled at the Rubenshuis from other scholars. His own reasons for never publishing his work on Rubens were his dissatisfaction with the ever-imperfect state of Rubens information.</td>\n",

His topic was on Han Holbein the Younger. Between 1931 and 1933 Cohn worked as a volunteer in the prints and drawings and library sections at the Staatlichen Museen in Berlin. When the Nazis came to power, Cohn, a protestant of Jewish lineage, was dismissed from his position. He worked for the Heitz publishing firm in Strassburg on their book series on prints (Einblattdrucke) from specific publishers and libraries until 1935 when he emigrated to Italy. There, New York University professor Richard Offner (q.v.) hired him as an assistant, in addition to another German, Klara Steinweg (q.v.), to work on his corpus of Florentine painting, the &lt;u&gt;Critical and Historical Corpus of Florentine Painting&lt;/u&gt;. When World War II erupted in Europe, Cohn and Offner left for the United States and Steinweg back to Germany. Cohn spent the war years back in Italy, in Assisi, gathering material on the influence of the \"commune\" on 13th-century cultural life. After the war, Cohn returned to Florence where he worked as a translator and in the archives of the Uffizi.

After receiving the highest honors of her Abiturum from the Gymnasium under which she studied, she won a scholarship which enabled her to spend a year at Wells College, Aurora, NY. She returned to Germany only to find Nazi control of her selected university, Munich, too much to for a Jew such as herself to tolerate. She moved to Perugia in 1935 only to find the same political hatred there. She stayed with friends at the University in Cardiff, Wales, before securing a scholarship via the Institute for International Education to attend Bryn Mawr in 1938. She received US citizenship the same year. Without an undergraduate degree, Achenbach was permitted to begin graduate work, achieving an M.A. in 1940. In 1945 Charles Rufus Morey (q.v.) offered Achenbach a position with the Index of Christian Art at Princeton. She worked there while writing her dissertation at the Institute of Fine Art at New York University under Richard Offner (q.v.). An photograph often used in art historiographic texts of the post-war faculty of the Institute is a picture of her Ph.D. defense. Achenbach married a Princeton physicist, Thomas Coor in 1946. She received her Ph.D. in 1948 on a topic of Coppo di Marcovaldo. The years 1948-50 were spent with her husband in London where she was informally attached to the Warburg Institute. Returning to Princeton, the Coors settled permanently with Gertrude again working at the Index of Christian Art and teaching courses at Rutgers University in 1958 and 1959. She accepted a research assistant position under Millard Meiss (q.v.) at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton in 1959. In 1961 her book on Neroccio de' Landi appeared. As a woman in the 1950s married to a university professor, she was expected to keep house and run the other domestic activities in addition to whatever scholarship she wanted to pursue. Coor purportedly worked sixteen hours every day on her research in addition to her wife duties. Coor was a consultant for the Kress Collection at the Cleveland Museum of Art. She was at work on a book on the evolution of the Sienese altarpiece when she contracted a terminal illness and died at 47.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Early historian of photography; scholar of graphics in general. Schwarz graduated from the Akademisches Gymnasium in Vienna with an Abitur in 1913. He entered the university in Vienna studying art history, archaeology and philosophy. At the outbreak of World War I, Schwarz served in the Austrian miliary, 1914, assigned to the field artillery. He resumed his studies in 1919, writing a disseration on the beginning of lithography in Vienna, under the \"Vienna School\" scholar &lt;a href=\"/dvorakm\"&gt;Max Dvo»íçk&lt;/a&gt;, though his degree came after Dvo»íçk's death in 1921. He worked as a volunteer at the Albertina Musum print collection, 1921-1923. Still unsalaried, he was promoted to a scholar research assistant from 1923 to 1927. That yeat, 1927 he accepted a position as curator at the Austrian Gallery, \"Baroque Museum\" (Belvedere) in the 19th-century gallery under F. M. Haberditzl. Schwarz was responsible for many exhibitions on 19th-century art at the museum, which opened in 1929, foreign exhibitions, as well as the 1934 Venice Biennale. Though Schwarz' field of study was graphics in general, his early interest in photography as an art medium made him a pioneer in the field. He was the first to write (in 1931) on the photographer David Octavius Hill. The annexation of Austria by the Nazis in 1938 meant that Schwarz, a Roman Catholic of Jewish decent, could no longer work in national museums. Schwarz sold part of his personal library to move to Sweden the same year. He immigrated to the United States in 1940 working as a research assistant at the Albright Knox Museum in Buffalo, NY. Schwarz received financial living assistance from &lt;a href=\"/warburge\"&gt;Edward M. \"Eddie\" Warburg&lt;/a&gt;, an arts benefactor, amateur art historians and nephew of art historian &lt;a href=\"/warburga\"&gt;Aby Warburg&lt;/a&gt;. In 1943 he was appointed curator for painting, drawing and prints at the Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design. He married in 1948, remaining at RISD until 1953. After two years as a visiting professor, 1954-1956, at Wesleyan University, Middletown, CT, he taught as professor there 1956-1962 and as the curator of the Davidson Art Center Collection (the latter through 1972). Schwarz lectured at visiting professor at Columbia University between 1966 and 1968 as a replacement for &lt;a href=\"/heldj\"&gt;Julius Held&lt;/a&gt;. He retired emeritus in 1972. \"Schwarz was a pioneer of the study of photography's historical evolution and development and its relationship with the traditional pictorial arts. He proposed that photography benefited from the 'inner-preparedness' it had been given by the fact that the 'fixed viewpoint had become the &lt;em&gt;alpha&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;omega&lt;/em&gt; of the aesthetic credo.\" (Hamber). Beaumont Newhall characterized Schwarz's book on Hill as one where the author recognized and treated Hill as an artist who \"happened to use a camera.\" (Wendland).</td>\n",

       "      <td>Scholar of medieval and renaissance architectural and art history; professor at the University of Chicago 1945-1957. Simson was the son of Ernst Eduard von Simson, and undersecretary of state in the German foreign office, and Martha Enole (von Simson), a descendent of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786). His great grandfather had originally been Jewish but converted to Roman Catholicism. Simson himself grew up in the cultured home of his grandfather, the chemist Franz Oppenheim (1852-1929) in the \"Villa Oppenheim.\" Their neighbor was the director of the Hamburg Kunsthalle &lt;a href=\"/lichtwarka\"&gt;Alfred Lichtwark&lt;/a&gt;, who inhabited the villa formerly owned by Max Liebermann. The young Simson grew up among the masterworks of German Impressionism. His family was highly distinguished in German politics and statecraft, his father served as a state administrator. Simson attended the Arndtgymnasium in Berlin Dahlem Dorf. After graduation (age 17) he was sent to England to learn English. After returning, he entered the university in Freiburg studying art history under under &lt;a href=\"/jantzenh\"&gt;Hans Jantzen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/friedlanderw\"&gt;Walter Friedlí_nder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"/bauchk\"&gt;Kurt Bauch&lt;/a&gt;. He studied briefly in Berlin before focusing moving to Munich in 1932 to study under &lt;a href=\"/pinderw\"&gt;Wilhelm Pinder&lt;/a&gt;. Most of Simson's work, however was under &lt;a href=\"/eversh\"&gt;Hans Eberhard Evers&lt;/a&gt;. Simson completed a dissertation on Rubens, and published as &lt;u&gt;Zur Genealogie der weltlichen Apotheose im Barock, besonders der Medicigalerie des Peter Paul Rubens&lt;/u&gt;, in 1936. He married the princess Aloysia (Louise) Alexandra von Schí_nburg Hartenstein (1906-1976) the same year. Simson worked initially at the Courtauld Institute Library in 1936 and as an editor for the periodical &lt;u&gt;Hochland&lt;/u&gt; in Munich. He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1937. With Germany's seizure of Czech lands, the so-called Czech Crisis, Simson was drafted into the German army. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Simson used his military &lt;i&gt;Wehrpass&lt;/i&gt; (military pass) to visit American museums on the excuse of his being an art historian; he remained in the U.S. with his wife and children following. He taught briefly at Marymount College in Tarrytown, New York (1939-43) (an offer to teach at Johns Hopkins came too late) and St. Mary's College in Notre Dame, Indiana. In 1945 University of Chicago president Robert Maynard Hutchins (1899-1977) offered Simson a job in the University's Committee on Social Thought and only secondarily in the Department of Art. He rose to full professor in 1951. During this period he produced two major books characteristic of his methodology. The first, &lt;u&gt;The Sacred Fortress&lt;/u&gt; (he despised the title; it was suggested by his editor) appeared in 1948. He was also a guest resident at the University of Frankfurt in the years immediately after the war. Simson's &lt;u&gt;The Gothic Cathedral&lt;/u&gt; appeared in 1956 and with it a rave review in the &lt;u&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/u&gt;, but a caustic review by &lt;a href=\"/crosbys\"&gt;Sumner Crosby&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;u&gt;Art Bulletin&lt;/u&gt;. The heated exchange broke a long-standing friendship between the two. Simson returned to Germany in 1957, taking a position first at the university Frankfurt, and then as the first German member of UNESCO. In 1964 he became Director of the Kunsthistorisches Institut of the Freie Universití_t in Berlin (succeeding literary historian Hans Kaufmann, 1926-2000) and professor of modern art. At the Freie Universití_t he was instrumental in sponsoring several conferences on Dutch art, such as the 1970 one on Rembrandt and the 1975 one on Brueghel. In 1972 he edited and wrote the revision to the prestigious &lt;u&gt;Propylí_en Kunstgeschichte&lt;/u&gt; volume on the middle ages, &lt;u&gt;Das Mittelalter II: das Hohe Mittelalter&lt;/u&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"/fillitzh\"&gt;Hermann Fillitz&lt;/a&gt; and others. After the death of his first wife in 1976, he married another woman of noble lineage, Marie-Anne zu Salm-Reifferscheidt-Krautheim und Dyck (b. 1933) in 1978. He remained at the Freie Universití_t until 1979. In 1986 his book, &lt;u&gt;Der Blick nach Innen&lt;/u&gt;, the result of lectures he presented at Harvard on nineteenth-century German art, Simson put forth the concept of \"Innerlichkeit\" as characteristic in the work of four German painters, Caspar David Friedrich, Carl Spitzweg, Wilhelm Leibl and Ludwig Richter. The posthumous &lt;u&gt;Peter Paul Rubens (1577 1640) Humanist, Maler, Diplomat&lt;/u&gt; (1996) brought together Simson's work on the artist with whom he had been preoccupied, though little published, for much of his career. Simson's methodology was in large part to lay an intellectual &lt;em&gt;Geistesgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; framework over his studies of medieval architecture. His book &lt;u&gt;The Sacred Fortress&lt;/u&gt; deals with the mosaics of Ravenna in terms of the liturgy which would have been used at the time. Because of the war, Simson never had a chance to examine the mosaics during the time he wrote the book. His &lt;u&gt;Gothic Cathedral&lt;/u&gt; put him in the middle of a wider, 20th-century dialogue on Gothic architecture with &lt;a href=\"/sedlmayrh\"&gt;Hans Sedlmayr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/panofskye\"&gt;Erwin Panofsky&lt;/a&gt; and Crosby. He and Sedlmayr wrote of the Gothic church as a mystical &lt;em&gt;Gesamtkunstwerk&lt;/em&gt;, a totality of all artistic media, whose meaning had to be derived from experiencing the building as a whole, as opposed to scholars who sought to dissect a building to interpret its iconographic parts (Crossley). Simson's erudite study of Abbot Suger's choir in the &lt;u&gt;Gothic Cathedral&lt;/u&gt; postulated the formation of the Gothic as a combination of \"Pseudo-Dionysian light metaphysics\" and the harmonic ratios of musical cosmology. This interpretation was challenged by &lt;a href=\"/gosebruchm\"&gt;Martin Gosebruch&lt;/a&gt; and denied by &lt;a href=\"/kidsonp\"&gt;Peter Kidson&lt;/a&gt; as over-intellectualizing. Simson's published dissertation on the secular apotheosis in Baroque art found praise early from Panofsky. Simson conceived his Propylí_en series &lt;u&gt;Das Mittelalter II: das Hohe Mittelalter&lt;/u&gt; as an extension of his &lt;u&gt;Gothic Cathedral&lt;/u&gt;, but greatly internationalized, with Polish scholars writing the sections on the art in Poland formerly under German rule. He was known as an engaging lecturer and warm to his many students.</td>\n",

He rose quickly to associate professor in 1940 and full professor in 1947. He was known for lecturing with his cocker spaniel at his side.

Stechow's father, Waldemar Stechow, was an attorney and his mother, Bertha Deutschmann, a concert singer. As a young man, Stechow was educated at the Gymnasium in Gí_ttingen and, after graduating in 1913, volunteered for the German Army at the outbreak of World War I the following year. In 1915 he was taken prisoner of war by the Russians and spent the next two years in a Siberian camp. He returned to Gí_ttingen where he wrote his dissertation at Georgia Augusta University under &lt;a href=\"/vitzthumg\"&gt;Count Georg Vizthum&lt;/a&gt; on the subject of Dí_rer's Apocalypse. He served as an assistant keeper of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin, under &lt;a href=\"/bodew\"&gt;Wihlem von Bode&lt;/a&gt; 1921-1922, before he returning to Gí_ttingen (1923-1935). There he taught courses as a &lt;em&gt;privatdozent&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href=\"/pevsnern\"&gt;Nikolaus Pevsner&lt;/a&gt;. There, too, he collaborated as part of the group of German scholars &lt;a href=\"/hofstededegrootc\"&gt;Hofstede de Groot&lt;/a&gt; assembled for his new volumes of the &lt;em&gt;catalogue raisonní©&lt;/em&gt; of Dutch Painting (1923, 1926). Stechow wrote his &lt;em&gt;Habilitationsschrift&lt;/em&gt; in 1926 on Dutch mannerism, also under Vizthum. A talented violinist and keyboardist, Stechow performed and organized musical concerts in Gí_ttingen between 1923-1936. During the same time, he contributed many entries for the 37-volume \"Thieme-Becker\" &lt;u&gt;Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden Kí_nstler&lt;/u&gt; on Dutch artists. He was appointed Extraordinarius professor at Gí_ttingen in 1931. A protestant of Jewish decent, he lost his academic position at the hands of the Nazi government in 1936. Vizthum sheltered him long enough for Stechow to publish his Salomon Ruysdael book and catalog in 1938. Stechow emigrated to the United States in the same year, were art historian &lt;a href=\"/hageno\"&gt;Oskar Hagen&lt;/a&gt;, a friend from Gí_ttingen days, secured him a position as Assistant Professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where Hagen also taught. Stechow left Madison for Oberlin College in 1940, a position he held until his emeritus designation in 1963. Stechow was a renowned teacher who made the deliberate choice to devote his energies to pedagogy rather than book publication. Although his articles number over 200, he produced comparatively few monographs. His best known work, &lt;u&gt;Dutch Landscape Painting of the Seventeenth Century&lt;/u&gt; (1966) was written after his retirement. In 1964 he began as advisory curator at the Cleveland Museum of Art, where he was instrumental in acquiring outstanding Dutch paintings. Stechow lectured and taught extensively during his life. It was while at Princeton teaching a class in retirement, that he died. A second edition of the Ruysdael catalog appeared after his death. Stechow's training was strong in connoisseurship, to which he added the study of iconography. Although excellent in what he did, his methodology attracted criticism. &lt;a href=\"/steinbergl\"&gt;Leo Steinberg&lt;/a&gt; criticized Stechow in a book review which Stechow took personally, causing a noted enmity between the two the remainder of their careers. Stechow is most closely associated with authenticity of paintings using connoisseurship (Rysdael). His other major monograph, &lt;u&gt;Dutch Landscape Painting&lt;/u&gt;, shows him avoiding the common practice of historic periodization in favor of thematic groupings. The chair of Oberlin during the 1950s, &lt;a href=\"/parkhurstc\"&gt;Charles Parkhurst&lt;/a&gt;, recalled Stechow's affinities for puns and great wit; Stechow, he said, referred to the introductory course in art history as \"From mud to Klee.\" His students included &lt;a href=\"/gersonh\"&gt;Horst Gerson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/schonew\"&gt;Wolfgang Schí_ne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/gronauh\"&gt;Hans Gronau&lt;/a&gt;, Reinhold Behrens and Adolf Isermeyer. Writing on Stechow's behalf in 1934 for immigration to the United States, &lt;a href=\"/panofskye\"&gt;Erwin Panofsky&lt;/a&gt; praised him as, \"the most distinguished younger art historians of Germany..</td>\n",

       "      <td>Kress Foundation art historian; Italian renaissance specialist. Suida was born to Albert Suida and Betha von Heim, his mother a descendant of Richard Wagner. His uncle was the art historian &lt;a href=\"/thodeh\"&gt;Henry Thode&lt;/a&gt;. After attending a Gymnasium in Vienna, he studied art history in Vienna under &lt;a href=\"/riegla\"&gt;Alois Riegl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/wickhofff\"&gt;Franz Wickhoff&lt;/a&gt;, in Leipzig and finally Heidelberg under Thode with whom he wrote his dissertation in 1899. It was published the following year. Between 1902-04 he was an assistant at the Deutsches Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence, the model for Italian research institutes, where he researched the book for his habilitation. He qualified with a 1905 monograph on Florentine painting. He taught as a &lt;i&gt;Privatdozent&lt;/i&gt; in Vienna and for the academic year 1909-10 at the Technische Hochschule in Graz, Austria. Beginning in 1911 was appointed a professor of art history at the university in Graz, and managed the picture gallery (Bildergalerie) of the Landesmuseum Joanneum in Graz. During World War I he fought as a captain. Between 1934-38 he was on leave teaching at various schools in Austria and Italy, but with the annexation of Austria by the Nazis in 1939, he emigrated first to England and then to the United States. In 1947 he found a position as Head of the department of art-historical research at the Kress Foundation, advising on art purchases for Samuel Kress and later helping to disperse the collection to museums across the United States. His daughter Bertina Suida (d. 1992) studied art history at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts where she met fellow art history student Robert Manning. They married and the elder Suida gave his son-in-law a position as curator for the Kress collection. Bertina was a curator at the Chrysler Collection. William and his children amassed large personal collections of Baroque art. Suida was an expert in Lombard art and only slightly less Venetian. At his death in 1959, his collection passed to his children. The combined art collection was donated to the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas, Austin, in1999, as the Suida-Manning Collection.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Medievalist and modernist; Director of Frankfurt art museums and later a Museum of Fine Art, Boston acquisitions curator, 1939-1957. Swarzenski's father was Adolf Hanns Swarzenski, a prosperous Dresden merchant originally of Jewish origin, and his mother, Auguste Beck (Swarzenski). In 1896 graduated with a degree in law from Heidelberg. He married Ella Perec-Wilcynska, [name sometimes appearing as Pertz-Wilcynska] in 1899, turning his attention to art history. Swarzenski studied art under the great medievalist Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.) in Berlin and in Heidelberg under Henry Thode (q.v.), gaining his second degree in 1901. His dissertation was on the Regensburg school of manuscript illumination of the tenth and eleventh centuries. He initially worked as an assistant at the research assistant at the Berlin Museums where he likely habilitated in 1903, when he was designation a privatdozent. After a year as an assistant at the Kunsthistorischen Institut in Florence, he returned to Berlin as an assistant for the Kunstgewerbemuseum (\"useful arts\" museum). In 1906 he was appointed director of the Stí_delsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt, a privately endowed and operated art museum, which Thode had at one time directed. Seeing the need to acquire more art than the Stí_delsches could afford, Swarzenski convinced the city of Frankfurt to found its own, publicly funded art museum, the Stí_dtische Galerie, (municipal gallery) to buy works, under Swarzenski's direction, to complement the Stí_delsches holdings. The Stí_dtische collection grew to include works by the Impressionists (Monet) and Post-Impressionists (Cí©zanne and van Gogh) and later by Picasso, Munch, Ensor and Die Brí_cke artists and others of German Expressionism, some of whom taught at the Kunstinstitut. He hired the fledgling art historian Fritz Wichert (q.v.) to assist him. In 1909 Swarzenski opened a combined museum, though still distinct in terms of collections, which he jointly directed with the Liebieghaus sculpture museum. He married a second time in 1916, to Marie Mí_ssinger. The following year, he contributed essays on modern art for the important survey, &lt;u&gt;Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft&lt;/u&gt;. Together with his assistant, the art historian Alfred Wolters (q.v.), he founded the &lt;u&gt;Stí_del Jahrbuch&lt;/u&gt; beginning in 1921 (which they co-edited through 1936). About this time, he began a liaison with Calola Netter, whom he installed in the museum as his intern. A double portrait of his wife and mistress was painted by Max Beckmann in 1923. Swarzenski was gifted museum innovator. He organized period rooms for decorative arts in his museums. Between 1925-1931 he held musical concerts in the rooms, one of the first directors to do so. His knowledge of the art market brought many masterworks to his museums. He was also of sufficient means that he could afford to donate pictures to the museum personally; the famous van Gogh portrait of Dr. Gachet was one of these. Swarzenski wrote columns in the local newspaper, the &lt;u&gt;Frankfurter Zeitung&lt;/u&gt;, communicating his interests and the museums' needs to the German and greater European public. In 1928 Swarzenski was appointed Director-General of all Frankfurt museums. He used his new position to purchase a significant part of the large Sigmaringen collection. The museum's Kunstgewerbemuseum, also rose to prominence under Swarzenski's direction. As a director somewhat ahead of his time, he mounted an early \"blockbuster\" show, a display of goldsmithing work, known as the Welfenschatz, which attracted huge crowds from the region. The rise of the Nazis to power in 1933 put Swarzenski into direct conflict with their ideas of art. Forced to remove many works of modernist art from the museums walls because of their \"degenerate\" designation by the Nazis--and distrusted for his Jewish background--Swarzenski ultimately resigned in 1938 and fled to United States. Many of the modernist works he acquired, including his personal donation of the Dr. Gachet, were deaccessioned and sold. In the United States, he lectured at Institute for Advance Studies, Princeton, NJ, for the 1938-1939 year before Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Director G. H. Edgell (q.v.) offered him a position to build the medieval area of the collection. His 1940 Boston exhibition, \"Arts of the Middle Ages: 1000-1400,\" marked Boston as a center of interest in the middle ages. He retired in 1956 and was succeeded by his son, Hanns Swarzenski (q.v.) who also distinguished himself at Boston as an art historian.</td>\n",

Swarzenski grew up in Frankfurt, Germany, where his father, Georg Swarzenski (q.v.) was the director of the Stí_delsches Kunstinstitut (museum) and the Liebieghaus sculpture museum. His mother was Ella Perec-Wilcynska, [name sometimes appearing as Pertz-Wilcynska]. As a young man he met the German Expressionist artist Max Beckmann who taught at the Stí_delsches school. He studied art history at Freiburg under Walter Friedlaender (q.v.), in Berlin, under Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.), under whom his father had also studied, and from whom he likely honed his connoisseurship skills. While pursuing his dissertation, he participated in the &lt;em&gt;Jahrtausundaustellung&lt;/em&gt; (millenial celebration) in Dí_sseldorf in 1925 under Fritz Witte (q.v.). The exhibition gave him early and unusual experience with manuscripts and medieval art. He received his Ph.D. from the University in Bonn in 1927 with a dissertation on medieval German book illumination under Paul Clemen (q.v.). He became a fellow of the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence. He was awarded a travel grant to study as a Fellow at the Fogg Museum, Harvard University in 1928. He returned to Berlin and worked at the state art museums there as a stagiaire. In Berlin, Swarzenski kept abreast of all the arts, becoming acquainted with the Bauhaus and Brí_cke masters Mies van der Rohe, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Gerhard Marcks and Andreas Feininger. In 1936 he published his major work, &lt;u&gt;Die lateinischen illuminierten Handschriften des XIII. Jahrhunderts&lt;/u&gt;. He used the modest honorarium he was paid for the book to buy a Beckmann painting. He left Nazi-controlled Germany in 1938--although a Protestant Christian he was from a Jewish background--accepting an offer to assist Erwin Panofsky (q.v.) at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. His father resigned and followed a short while later. At the Institute, Swarzenski published his book on the Berthold Missal. He became acting curator of sculpture at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC in 1943 (many museum personnel were in the war). Upon their return in 1946 he lost his position. In 1948 he was offered a position as a Research fellow in Medieval art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where his father also held that status. In 1948 year he wrote a forward to a catalog on his friend, Beckmann, in the first American retrospective of his art in St. Louis, MO. Between 1950-1956 he periodically lectured at the Warburg Institute in London. He married Brigitte Horney, an actress, in 1953. The same year he published his important &lt;u&gt;Monuments of Romanesque Art&lt;/u&gt;, still a handbook for the period. He succeeded his father as Curator of Decorative Arts and Sculpture in the Museum in 1956, appointed by director Perry Rathbone (q.v.), whom he had known since Rathbone's days in St. Louis. Among Swarzenski's acquisitions during the Boston years were two works rejected as forgeries by other museums, the Lombard Virgin and Child, acquired in 1959, and an Ile-de-France Virgin and Child, both ca. 1200. In the early 1960s, Swarzenski identified a large 12th-century ivory cross offered to the Museum by a private seller. When he and Rathbone determined the Museum could not afford the treasure, it was referred to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Thomas Hoving (q.v.) who ultimately acquired it as the (now famous) Cloister's Cross. Hoving neglected to mention in his memoirs Swarzenski's contribution. As a curator for all European sculpture, Swarzenski also purchased works by Giacometti, Calder, Brancusi and Henry Moore for the Museum. A 1972 festschrift contained artwork commissioned by both Beckmann and Calder. In 1973 he retired to a home in Wilzhofen, Oberbayern, Germany, where he died in 1985. Swarzenski's &lt;u&gt;Monuments of Romanesque Art&lt;/u&gt; remains a characteristic work. It lacks extensive comment on the objects in favor of allowing the works to speak for themselves. Walter Cahn (q.v.) speculated that Swarzensky was equally uncomfortably with public oratory. A trained connoisseur in the postivistic vein of Goldschmidt, Swarzenski remained a true art historian rather than like so many German medievalists, an iconographer. His personal art collection, which, in addition to Beckmann, extended to Paul Klee and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, was made possible by art dealers who sold him these works modestly in exchange for Museum patronage of medieval works (Rathbone).</td>\n",

       "      <td>Historian of Renaissance and Baroque art; wife of art historian Hans Tietze (q.v.). Conrat was the daughter of Hugo Conrat, a wealthy Viennese businessman with an enormous passion for music. Brahms was a dinner guest during Conrat's childhood and versions of her father's poetry Brahms set to music (&lt;u&gt;Zigeunerlieder&lt;/u&gt;, opus 103). She attended the Institut Hanausek until age twelve and then the new Mí_dchenschule gymnasium, graduating in 1901. She attended the University of Vienna between 1902-1905 where she met a young art history graduate student, &lt;a href=\"/tietzeh\"&gt;Hans Tietze&lt;/a&gt;, both students of the first \"Vienna school\" art historian &lt;a href=\"/wickhofff\"&gt;Franz Wickhoff&lt;/a&gt;. She wrote and published her dissertation under Wickhoff in 1905 on Austrian baroque sculptor Georg Raphael Donner (1693-1741), only the second woman to be graduated in art history during Wickhoff's tenure. Conrat married Tietze in December of 1905, the same year as her first published article. As Europe lacked any significant teaching positions for women then, Tietze-Conrat assisted her husband in his first position as an investigator for the commission on preservation of Austrian monuments (Zentralkommision fí_r Denkmalpflege). The Tietzes had four children between 1908 and 1918. Her husband served in the Austrian army from 1914, his duties still connected with the preservation of monuments, only now in north Italy. The Tietzes were first and foremost a research team. The Tietzes left the raising of thier children to a trusted nanny (who lived with the family until age 90). Both from well-to-do families, the art historian husband/wife team saw as part of their mission the support of contemporary art in Vienna as well as its historical research. Oskar Kokoschka was commissioned to paint a portrait of the two in 1909 (today, Museum of Modern Art, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Fund, 651.39). Together they helped organize the Vienna Society for the Advancement of Contemporary Art (Gesellschaft zur Fí_rderung der modernen Kunst in Wien) in 1920. As art historians, the Tietzes worked closely together, their desks pushed facing each other in order to facilitate discussion. Each, however, continued to publish separately as well as together. Hans Tietze made guest lectures to the United States in 1932 and 1935, Erica joining him on the second journey. The discovery of a large amount of material in the Uffizi on Venetian drawings by Erica Tietze-Conrat gave her the idea to publish a catalog of drawings from the Republic. From 1935 onward they traveled with that thought in mind. When the &lt;i&gt;Anschluss&lt;/i&gt; came in 1938, Tietze-Conrat was in Italy, unaware of the situation. Her husband escaped Austria (both were from Jewish-extraction families) and met her in Italy. After word that their grown children were safe, the couple continued their research, visiting museums in the Netherlands and Paris. In 1939 they emigrated to the United States, leaving their housekeeper to watch over their Austrian home throughout the war. Hans Tietze taught for a single year as a Carnegie Professor at the Toledo Museum of Art before the couple moved to New York. During these financially difficult times, they sold their Kokoschka and joined the large cultural expatriate community there. They became American citizens in 1944. Hans never found an academic appointment in America, his only income coming from occasional assignments from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art, Washington. When Columbia University offered him a course on Venetian art in the spring semester of 1954, Tietze, who was dying of cancer, was too ill to finish the class. Erica completed the lectures and was subsequently asked to lecture at Columbia again in 1955 and 1956. This was her only academic position as well. Her strong convictions to art remained. As a young Ph.D. candidate from Princeton, &lt;a href=\"/hovingt\"&gt;Thomas Hoving&lt;/a&gt; recalled Tietze Conrat's intimidating shouts of \"You--Are--Wrong!\" at graduate student symposia at the Frick Collection (McPhee). In 1955 she published a monograph on Mantegna and two years later, &lt;u&gt;Dwarfs and Jesters in Art&lt;/u&gt;. In 1970 a room in the í_sterreichisches Barockmuseum, Lower Belvedere, was named in her honor for having revived the study of neglected Austrian masters such as Donner. Both Tietze-Conrat and her husband are noted for their compilation of fastidious catalogs. The three-volume critical catalog of Albrecht Dí_rer (1928-38) contains all the categories of a modern evaluative &lt;em&gt;catalogue raisonní©&lt;/em&gt;. Many of the articles both published were the result of their research in catalog compilation. Their second combined achievement, a critical catalog of Venetian drawings (1944), required that they examine a relatively untouched area of Italian works on paper. Unlike Roman or Florentine, Venetian drawings were relatively unstudied. Savvy enough to understand that students often copied master drawings, they used carefully developed standards to authenticate autograph pieces. Some of their findings and attributions have not borne the test of time, particularly their assertion that the \"Sketchbooks of Jacopo Bellini\" represent many artists work over a range of years.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\"Vienna School\"-trained historian of Venetian art; author of a major \"principles of art history\" monograph and developer of Baroque Museum, Vienna. Tietze was the son of a Czech lawyer, Siegfried Tietze (d. 1920), and Auguste Pohl. The family name had originally been Taussig. He attended the Gymnasium Altstadt in Prague. His father converted the family from Judaism to protestant Christianity in 1893 moving the family to Vienna. Tietze graduated from the Schottengymnasium there in 1898. Anxious to be seen as fully Austrian, he volunteered for a year's service in the Austrian army 1899-1900. Following discharge he entered the university in Vienna studying archaeology and history and art history between 1900-1903. Vienna's art history program was in the midst of solidifying its famous \"Vienna School\" methodology and Tietze studied with the masters including &lt;a href=\"/riegla\"&gt;Alois Riegl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/schlosserj\"&gt;Julius von Schlosser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/wickhofff\"&gt;Franz Wickhoff&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote his dissertation under Wickhoff on the topic of medieval typological representation, awarded his degree in 1903. His article on Francesco de Hollanda was termed by Schlosser \"an exemplary piece of research\" (Held). In 1905 he married fellow Vienna art-history student &lt;a href=\"/tietzee\"&gt;Erika Conrat&lt;/a&gt; who hailed from a prominent and cultural Viennese family. Tietze wrote his &lt;em&gt;habilitation&lt;/em&gt; (also under Wickhoff) on the topic of Anibale Caracci's frescos at the Palazzo Farnese, accepted in 1905. Study of baroque artists was still rare in academic art history, the period generally considered degenerate. Tietze worked as Wickhoff's assistant holding an &lt;i&gt;ad personam&lt;/i&gt; chair in the Erstes Kunsthistorisches Institut of &lt;a href=\"/strzygowski\"&gt;Josef Strzygowski&lt;/a&gt;. The Tietzes raised their four children largely with a governness so as to be able to devote their energies to art. He became an assisant at the Commission for Monument Preseveration (Zentralkommission fí_r Denkmalplege), rising to secretary of the Commision in 1909. Headng a relatively small staff, he oversaw an inventory of monuments ultimately comprising thirteen volumes, &lt;u&gt;í_sterreichische Kunsttopographie&lt;/u&gt;. In 1909, too, he was accepted as a &lt;em&gt;Privatdozent&lt;/em&gt; at the University. Tietze and his wife enthusiastically supported modern art, commissioning the twenty-three-year-old expressionist paingter Oskar Kokoschka to paint their marriage portrait in 1909. When World War I broke out, he mobilized into the army again intially seeing action but later as an officer assigned to art protection in Italy (1914-1918). At the war's conclusion--disastrous for Austria--he, as a negotiator for war reparations of Austrian art, skillfully kept Austria's heritage intact (Buschbeck). Afterward, Tietze received an &lt;em&gt;ausserordentlicher&lt;/em&gt; (assistant) professor appointment at Vienna and began editing the periodical &lt;u&gt;Die bildenden Kí_nste&lt;/u&gt;. The next year Tietze submitted a proposal for the reorganization of Austrian museums and was appointed by Emil Fí_rster-Streffleur to the art section of the Austrian government's instruction initiatvie (í_sterreichische Staatsamt fí_r Unterricht). In 1920, too, the Tietzes consolidated their position as major public exponents of modern art by joining the Association for the Promotion of Modern Art in Vienna (Gesellschaft zur Fí_derung der modernen Kunst in Wien). Beginning in 1923, Tietze reorganized the art museum system in Vienna from its imperial arrangement to one more reflecting the popular and pedagogical direction of the new federal goverment, integrating the Hapsburg collections into existing museums. This included combining of the print collection of the Hofbibliothek into the Albertina collection and the creation of the Belvedere galleries: the baroque museum in the Lower Belvedere, the 19th-century museum in the Upper Belvedere and the modern (20th-century) art museum in the Orangerie. He worked at this successfully until 1925 when he resigned over bureaucratic frustrations. He continued as a private teacher with a titular appointment to the University with a new outlook toward art--to portray art and artists as fully real players in history and not simply producers of art (Gombrich, 1954), writing radio broadcasts on art. His knowlege of modern art and respect as a scholar allowed him to continue to advise Austrian museums on purchase of late-19th-century (\"Post-Impressionist) art. He embarked on a new assessment of Albrecht Dí_rer, joined by Erica. Volume one, &lt;u&gt;Der junge Dí_rer&lt;/u&gt;, appeared in 1928, a ground-breaking work for its integration of all Dí_rer media and its \"ruthless rejection of many traditional and recent attributions\" (Gombrich, 1954). It was the new approach to Dí_rer that led him to study Venentian art, a favorite of his mentor, Wickhoff. Tietze made guest lectures to the United States in 1932 and 1935. The text for a catalog on Venetian renaissance drawings by the the pair was completed 1935 but remained unpublished until the English edition of 1944. A monograph on Titian was issued in 1936. The annexation of Austria by the Nazis in 1938 resulted in Tietze's &lt;em&gt;non-grata&lt;/em&gt; status as a pacificist and of \"non-Arian\" background. While traveling in Italy, the Tietzes were forbidden to return and their home plundered. The couple fled to London and then the United States leaving their apartment in the hands of their housekeeper. Tietze secured an appointment as a visiting professor at the Toledo Museum of Art under a Carnegie Foundation support for 1938-1939. The following year the couple settled in New York city, sold their Kokoschka to the Museum of Modern Art (1939) living as private scholars. Tietze wrote introductions to European art catalogs for various regional American museums, lighter books for a general public (\"great art\" surveys and a book on forgeries) and continued his steady stream of scholarly aricles. He secured occasional assignments from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. He lectured at Columbia University on Venetian painting in the spring semester of 1954, but, already ill with cancer, was too ill to finish the class. The course was completed by Erica. He was cremated and his ashes buried under a tree at their summer home in New Boston, MA. Students greatly influenced by his teaching in Vienna included &lt;a href=\"/gombriche\"&gt;Ernst H. Gombrich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/kurzo\"&gt;Otto Kurz.&lt;/a&gt; Tietze's &lt;em&gt;Geistesgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; approach to art history--most clearly seen in the Dí_rer catalogs--a view of an artist as a living personality and not as an evolution of styles--was directly inherited from his Vienna School training. He was fascinated by neglected periods and genres; his early research into the Bolognese Anibale Carracci perhaps influenced the younger Kurz to write his dissertation on the (still unfashionable) baroque artist Guido Reni. The Tietzes as a scholarly couple divided their work between Hans, the theorist and actual writer of the texts and Erica who provided the details (Held). E. H. Gombrich characterized Tietze's &lt;u&gt;Methode der Kunstgeschichte&lt;/u&gt; as, in addition to displaying Tietze's learning, betraying the inner crisis of art history: what, in fact, the goal of the art historian should be (Gombrich, 1954). Both Tietzes were intense driving personalities, a fact remarked upon by friends and adversaries alike. Kokoschka described his sitters as \"closed personalities so full of tension\" (MoMA). Julius Held, in a saludatory obituary, characterized Tietze as \"uncompromising\" and \"strong willed.\" This assured, unbending nature proved a detriment as much as an advantage. Tietze, who had made such significant reforms in Austrian museum culture, found himself shut out of appointments in the American Art Museum world. His lack of admiration for connoisseurship as an end--a staple of art museology--brought distrust from museum directors. \"To identify connoisseurship with art history would be like confusing detection with jurisprudence,\" he remarked (Gombrich, 1954). The offense this caused can be seen in two reviews of Tietze books by the Art Institute of Chicago associate director &lt;a href=\"/maxonj\"&gt;John Maxon&lt;/a&gt;, whose analysis appeared so vindictive that that Columbia scholar David Rosand (b. 1938) decried it in print as a personal vendetta by Maxon. Udo Kultermann characterized Tietze as \"one of the outstanding scholars both in the area of the art of the Renaissance and of the modern era.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Michelangelo scholar and Columbia University professor. Tolnay was the son of Arnold von Tolnai, an high-ranking official of the Hungarian administration of the Austro-Hungarian government. He graduated from the Staatsovergymnasium in Budapest, where he was raised, in 1918. Tolnay was a participant in the famous Budapest &lt;em&gt;Sonntagskreis&lt;/em&gt; (Sunday Circle) whose members included intellectuals such as the philosopher Georg Lukíçcs (1885-1971) and art historians &lt;a href=\"/hausera\"&gt;Arnold Hauser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/antalf\"&gt;Frederick Antal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"/wildej\"&gt;Johannes Wilde&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning in 1918, Tolnay studied art history and archaeology in Berlin (under &lt;a href=\"/goldschmidta\"&gt;Adolph Goldschmidt&lt;/a&gt;), in Frankfurt (under &lt;a href=\"/kautzschr\"&gt;Rudolf Kautzsch&lt;/a&gt;) and Vienna, completing his dissertation in 1925 under the pre-eminent Vienna-School scholar &lt;a href=\"/schlosserj\"&gt;Julius Schlosser&lt;/a&gt;. His dissertation topic was on Hieronymous Bosch. Methodologically, however, Tolnay was as much influenced by &lt;a href=\"/dvorakm\"&gt;Max Dvo»íçk&lt;/a&gt;, another of the Vienna scholars. He moved to Rome, researching the topic that would become his life's major focus, Michelangelo. In 1928 he became a privatdozent associated with the University of Hamburg, coming into contact with the young &lt;a href=\"/panofskye\"&gt;Erwin Panofsky&lt;/a&gt; and writing his habilitation in 1929 on Michelangelo's late architecture. He married Rina Ada Clara Bartolucci in 1930. He received research grants from the Bibliotheca Hertziana for additional study in Rome. Tolnay objected to the Nazi's policies and, although not Jewish himself, he, along with many Jewish art historians, emigrated from Germany. He fled to Paris in 1933 where he worked as the Chargí© de Confí©rences at the Institut d'art et d'archí©ologie of the Sorbonne. Tolnay's 1939 book on the Master of Flí©malle, written in French during this period, established the now accepted notion that this artist is the same as the artist Robert Campin and likely the artist Jacques Daret. With Panofsky's written recommendation on his behalf, he immigrated to the United States in 1939, working at a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ, until 1948. During this time he issued the first of what would become his five-volume analysis on the work of Michelangelo, &lt;u&gt;The Youth of Michelangelo&lt;/u&gt;. He become a U.S. citizen as well. After a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1948-1949, he was named a Bollingen Fellow from 1949 until 1953. In 1953 Tolnay was appointed professor at Columbia University. He completed his Michelangelo series in 1960. Tolnay retired from Columbia in 1965 to become Director of the Casa Buonarotti in Florence. As director, he presided over the museum's rescue and restoration of the artworks damaged during the disastrous 1966 flood of the Arno river. He also reorganized the object numbering system and mounted several high-profile exhibitions. Tolnay married second time, to Anna-Marie Reps, a writer and painter, in 1971. During the final years of his life, he began issuing a corpus of Michelangelo drawings, &lt;u&gt;Corpus dei disegni di Michelangelo&lt;/u&gt;, the first volume of which appeared in 1975. He died at age 82 in Florence. In 1934, Panofsky wrote that Tolnay was \"one of the most brilliant art historians\" of their time (Wendland). As a connoisseur, Tolnay's attributions convinced the great Berlin scholar &lt;a href=\"/friedlanderm\"&gt;Max J. Friedlí_nder&lt;/a&gt; that some of Friedlí_nder's own attributions had been wrong. As a modernist, Tolnay he followed the theory of Fí_lep (whom he acknowledged) in an essay on Cí©zanne Tolnay published in Hungarian in 1924, arguing that Cí©zanne's importance was his technique of representing the fragmented world of modernity through his brushstrokes, \"which embodies the essence of form.\" (Lackí_). Tolnay was able to combine two disparate methodologies of his mentors, Goldschmidt and Dvo»íçk, into a cohesive approach, respecting both the object and a theoretical framework on which to place it (Salvini). His major work on Michelangelo was eminently readable, but suffered, according to some, from Tolnay's lack of contact with the original sources. His legacy was continued by the work of &lt;a href=\"/ackermanj\"&gt;James Ackerman&lt;/a&gt; (Lein).</td>\n",

After graduating from the humanistisches Gymnasium in Stettin in 1916, he entered the army in World War I where he was severely wounded. Upon recuperation in 1919 he studied political science, earning his first Ph.D. in 1923 from the university in Vienna. He entered studied thereafter in art history, attending lectures at Marburg under Richard Hamann (q.v.) and then Leipzig under Wilhelm Pinder (q.v.). His dissertation, written under Pinder, was on architects of Stettin in the eighteenth century. He volunteered at the Kunstgewerbemuseum (Arts and Crafts Museum) in Leipzig beginning in 1926. He married Suzanne Nei_er around this time. He worked for the publisher Brockhaus as an art editor briefly before being appointed an assistant at the city museum of Halle an der Saale in 1928. The following year he became an art history Dozent at the art academy in Kassel (Staatliche Kunstakademie Kassel). When the academy closed in 1932, he move to an unpaid curatorial assistant at the art museum there. Vogel's wife, because of her Jewish background, was declared a \"non-Aryan\" by the Nazis. He secured a grant to inventory the building and art of the Hohenzollern in Sigmaringen. This led to a 1936 project cataloging the print and book collection for Prince Friedrich Heinrich von Preussen in Kamenz in Schlesien, ultimately charged to liquidate some of the assets. At the end of War, Vogel was hounded by the Gestapo for his \"mixed marriage\" status to a Jew. After the War he was appointed director of the art museum at Kassel, 1946. An industrial city, Kassel suffered heavy bombing by allied forces and the museum building was heavily damaged. Vogel spent those years rebuilding the collection,the heavily damaged museum building was accomplished after his tenure. He oversaw the issuing of a catalog in 1958. He retired in 1962.

The younger Volbach attended school in Mainz and Bensheim, receiving his &lt;em&gt;abitur&lt;/em&gt; in 1911. After graduation, he volunteered at the Rí_misch-Germanisches Zentralmusem (Roman antiquities museum) in Mainz 1911 and 1915. He further volunteered at the Landesmuseum in Wiesbaden, reinstalling the collection when the director was killed in World War I. During this same period, Volbach studied archaeology, art history and medieval history at the universities of Munich, Berlin (under &lt;a href=\"/goldschmidta\"&gt;Adolph Goldschmidt&lt;/a&gt;), Tí_bingen (under &lt;a href=\"/langek\"&gt;Konrad von Lange&lt;/a&gt;) and finally Gieíôen (Giessen) under &lt;a href=\"/rauchc\"&gt;Christian Rauch&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote his dissertation in 1916 under Rauch at Giessen on the topic of the figure of St. George in medieval German art. The Kaiser-Friedrich Museum director &lt;a href=\"/bodew\"&gt;Wilhelm Bode&lt;/a&gt; hired him for his museum in 1917. With &lt;a href=\"/vitzthumg\"&gt;Count Georg von Vitzthum&lt;/a&gt; he authored the &lt;u&gt;Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft&lt;/u&gt; volume on Italian medieval art. At the Museum he collaborated with Ernst F. Bange (1893-?) and Theodor Demmler on the catalog for the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. During this time he became a founding member and lecturer at the Volkshochschule in Berlin. Volbach was interested in the contemporary art scene in Berlin and knew many of &lt;em&gt;Die Brí_cke&lt;/em&gt; German Expressionists. He married Maria Luise Adelung (d. 1936) in 1928. The same year he met the Byzantinist &lt;a href=\"/duthuitg\"&gt;Georges Duthuit&lt;/a&gt;. In 1929 he was raised to curator (Kustos) and in 1930 head of the Early Christian and medieval Italian collection. He, Duthuit and &lt;a href=\"/sallesg\"&gt;Georges Salles&lt;/a&gt; collaborated on a book on Byzantine art in 1933. He was named professor in 1933 at the Volkshochschule but the same year determined to be \"non-Aryan\" (Volbach's mother was of Jewish extraction) by the new Nazi government. He and his wife, both practicing Roman Catholics, immigrated to the Vatican City in 1934. There he worked in the Vatican library and as a professor at the Papal Institute for Christian Archaeology. Volbach participated on anti-fascist committees with C. B. Todd and Ludwig Muckermann. He returned to Germany after the War in 1946. In 1948 he married a second time to Australian writer Vivyan Eyles (b. 1910), only recently divorced the writer and art historian &lt;a href=\"/prazm\"&gt;Mario Praz&lt;/a&gt;.

       "      <td>Princeton scholar, influential Byzantinist and medievalist. Weitzman was the son of Wilhelm Weitzman, a city school superintendent, and Antoine Keiper. Weitzmann initially attended courses in the dominant art historical periods of that time, ancient and renaissance art at the universities of Mí_nster, Wí_rzburg and Vienna. His professors included the eminent of that time: &lt;a href=\"/wackernagelm\"&gt;Martin Wackernagel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/salisa\"&gt;Arnold von Salis&lt;/a&gt;, the theologian Adolf von Harnack (1851-1930), and Vienna-School giants &lt;a href=\"/schlosserj\"&gt;Julius von Schlosser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/strzygowski\"&gt;Josef Strzygowski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/swobodak\"&gt;Karl Maria Swoboda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"/lowye\"&gt;Emanuel Lí_wy&lt;/a&gt;. Weitzmann completed his education in Berlin under the distinguished archaeological art historian &lt;a href=\"/noackf\"&gt;Ferdinand Noack&lt;/a&gt; and the eminent medievalist art historian &lt;a href=\"/goldschmidta\"&gt;Adolph Goldschmidt&lt;/a&gt;. Goldschmidt directed Weitzmann's 1929 dissertation on ivory rosette caskets, &lt;u&gt;Die Elfenbeinkí_sten aus der mittelbyzantinsichen Zeit&lt;/u&gt;, which he and Weitzmann published as the first volume of Goldschmidt's corpus of medieval ivories, &lt;u&gt;Die byzantinischen Elfenbeinskulpturen des X.-XIII. Jahrhunderts&lt;/u&gt;. Weitzmann collaborated on the second volume of the series as well as his &lt;i&gt;Habilitation&lt;/i&gt; under Goldschmidt. During these years Weitzmann was a member of the Deutsches Archí_ologischen Institut in Berlin (1930-1934), using a stipend from that body for research in Athens, Patmos and Mount Athos (1931) and Berlin (1932-1934). In 1932 he married fellow Goldschmidt student Josepha Fiedler (1904-2000). Although not Jewish himself, his association with Goldschmidt, a Jew, and his refusal to join the Nazi party in order to teach as a &lt;i&gt;Dozent&lt;/i&gt; at the University mandated his leaving Germany. He left Berlin for Princeton University in 1935, where he remained the rest of his life teaching and writing. His wife followed in 1938. At Princeton, he was a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study, initially engaged in preparing a corpus of illustrated manuscripts of the Septuagint with &lt;a href=\"/moreyc\"&gt;Charles Rufus Morey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/frienda\"&gt;Albert M. Friend, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;. In 1938 he began his long association with Dumbarton Oaks, Harvard's research center for Byzantine studies, presenting the paper, \"Principals of Byzantine Book Illumination,\" even before the center was fully established. In 1945, he succeeded Morey as professor in the department of art history. He and Friend conducted a manuscript seminar until Weitzmann's retirement. His most influential book, &lt;u&gt;Illustrations in Roll and Codex&lt;/u&gt;, a distillation of his principles of manuscript interpretation, appeared in 1947 (later revised and reissued in 1970). He held visiting positions at Yale (1954-55). In 1956 he began his long research association with the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mt. Sinai. On his first visit he examined and photographed 2,000 manuscripts. Subsequent visits were sponsored by the Alexandria-Michigan-Princeton Expedition directed by &lt;a href=\"/forsythg\"&gt;George Forsyth&lt;/a&gt;. In 1960 he was visiting professor at Alexandria University. Weitzmann presented a manuscript seminar at the Universití_t Bonn in 1962. Together with &lt;a href=\"/kitzingere\"&gt;Ernst Kitzinger&lt;/a&gt; he organized the 1965 Dumbarton Oaks conference on Byzantine contribution to the art of the West of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. A second edition of his &lt;u&gt;Illustrations in Roll and Codex&lt;/u&gt; appeared in 1970. Named emeritus in the department in 1972, he relinquished his Institute appointment to be a visiting scholar at Dumbarton Oaks, 1972-1974. In 1977, Weitzmann organized an exhibition and symposium (with Margaret Frazer) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, entitled, \"The Age of Spirituality.\" The show recapped Weitzmann's originality in looking at the range of early medieval objects which both showed the unity of the objects and the adoption of pagen images into new meanings. Although the icons of St. Catherine's had been published in cursory form, Weitzmann's enthusiasm for them and the place they played in religious iconography resulted a longer treatment. With George Forsyth he issued &lt;u&gt;The Monastery of Saint Catherine on Mount Sinai&lt;/u&gt;. volume one on &lt;u&gt;The Church and Fortress  of Justinian&lt;/u&gt;, 1973 and a second volume of the Monastery, &lt;u&gt;The Icons&lt;/u&gt;, 1976, the former a result of Weitzmann's supervission of the restoration of the Transfiguration mosaic of St. Catherine's. A book on &lt;u&gt;The Frescoes of the Dura Synagogue and Christian Art&lt;/u&gt; co-authored with another of his students, &lt;a href=\"/kesslerh\"&gt;Herbert Kessler&lt;/a&gt; appeared in 1990. That year, too, his research on illuminations of the St. Catherine's Monastery research began to appear in book form. The first, published in collaboration with another former student, &lt;a href=\"/galavarisg\"&gt;George Galavaris&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;u&gt;The Illuminated Greek Manuscripts from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century&lt;/u&gt; His eyesight gone and his health failing rapidly in the spring of 1993, Weitzmann was conferred an honorary Doctor of Letters at bedside shortly before his death. Weitzmann was responsible for training many of the leading medievalists of the next generation. His students, in addition to Galavaris and Kessler, included Paul Underwood, &lt;a href=\"/martinj\"&gt;John Rupert Martin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/eitnerl\"&gt;Lorenz Eitner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/kochra\"&gt;Robert Koch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/hovingt\"&gt;Thomas Hoving&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/grabaro\"&gt;Oleg Grabar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/snyderj\"&gt;James Snyder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/kelinbauerw\"&gt;W. Eugene Kleinbauer&lt;/a&gt;, and Robert P. Bergman. &lt;u&gt;Roll and Codex&lt;/u&gt; illustrates Weitzmann's brilliance and methodology. Through precise visual analysis and archaeological evidence, he traced an evolution of illustrated manuscripts in the early Christian and Byzantine era, theorizing two turning points, Egyptian \"papyrus style\" and Greek \"continuous narrative\" style. From these two types, Weitzmann created a method of interpreting extant illustrations. In a 1990 Dumbarton Oaks publication, &lt;u&gt;The Frescoes of the Dura Synagogue and Christian Art&lt;/u&gt;, he argued effectively that Christian symbolism, rather than emerging from a slow progression on its own, developed from a Jewish tradition of images adopted from a classical vocabulary. His encounter with Crusader icons at St. Catherine's buttressed Weitzmann's conviction to study all of medieval art, which he did in numerous articles and lectures. His legacy to early medieval art was foremost not to see a rigid division between east and west.</td>\n",

She met and married the Jantzen student &lt;a href=\"/wescherp\"&gt;Paul Wescher&lt;/a&gt; in 1923, adopting his surname professionally. She received her Ph.D. in Freiburg (almost certainly under Jantzen) in 1924, writing her dissertation on the 16th-century painter Sebastian Dayg. After graduation, her husband secured a position at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (State Museum in Berlin) and she volunteered at the graphics division there as well, working under &lt;a href=\"/friedlanderm\"&gt;Max Friedlí_nder&lt;/a&gt;. Through Friedlí_nder she secured a position with the scholar assembling the Peter Paul Rubens &lt;i&gt;catalogue raisonn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;í©&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/burchardl\"&gt;Ludwig Burchard&lt;/a&gt;. Wescher became involved in the comtemporary art scene in Berlin, both through Roh, &lt;a href=\"/glaserc\"&gt;Curt Glaser&lt;/a&gt;, Curjel and the artist Líçszlí_ Moholy-Nagy. Strong supporters of the Weimar Republic and the Bauhaus school of architecture, she and her husband's views were directly opposed to the conservative art ideology of national socialism. With the accession to power of Hitler in 1933 the couple moved to Paris. Wescher worked as a journalist and, between 1936-1937, as a correspondent for the English art magazine &lt;u&gt;Axis&lt;/u&gt;. She helped organize the Freier Kí_nstlerbund, among whose members were the art historians Sabine Spiro and &lt;a href=\"/westheimp\"&gt;Paul Westheim&lt;/a&gt;. With France's entrance into World War II, she was interned in 1940. She and her husband fled to Switzerland in 1942, settling in Basle. At the conclusion of the war, she separated from her husband, returning to Paris in 1945. Wescher wrote freelance articles and in the early 1950s for &lt;u&gt;Art d'Aujourd'hui&lt;/u&gt;. In 1953 she helped found the journal &lt;u&gt;Cimaise&lt;/u&gt;. Among her topics at this time were collage. Wescher wrote a major monograph on the art form in 1968, &lt;u&gt;Die Collage&lt;/u&gt;. She died of a heart attack at age 72. .Wescher's career eclipsed that of her husband's, prinicipally through her specialty in the relatively unpublished area of collage. She became an authority on it and an early exponent of non-figurative art. The New York Times termed her book on collage \"a definitive summing up on that major technique in [the] 20th century.\" She and the Museum of Modern Art's &lt;a href=\"/seitzw\"&gt;William Seitz&lt;/a&gt; (through his 1961 show and book &lt;u&gt;Art of Assemblage&lt;/u&gt;) were the two main theorist until the late 20th century.</td>\n",

He attended a humanites Gymnasium in Freiburg, volunteering for World War I (fighting in field artillery) where he received his abitur in 1918. After the war studied art history, archaeology and literature in Freiburg and Munich beginning in 1919. Wescher studied under the major art historians of the time, including &lt;a href=\"/wolfflinh\"&gt;Heinrich Wí_lfflin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/franklp\"&gt;Paul Frankl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/mayera\"&gt;August L. Mayer&lt;/a&gt;, in Munich and then at Freibrug under &lt;a href=\"/friedlanderw\"&gt;Walter Friedlí_nder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/jantzenh\"&gt;Hans Jantzen&lt;/a&gt;. He completed his dissertation under Jantzen in 1923 writing on an aspect of manuscript illumination before the fourteenth century. The same year he married a fellow art historian &lt;a href=\"/wescherh\"&gt;Hertha Kauert [Wescher]&lt;/a&gt;. Wescher initially worked as a volunteer at the Augustiner-Museum in Freiburg, 1919-1921 before securing a job as a curatorial assistant at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (State Museum in Berlin), 1924-1927, where his wife also volunteered. In 1927 he was appointed to the graphics collection cataloging Flemmish drawings, publishing a catalog, &lt;u&gt;Beschreibendes Verzeichnis der Miniaturen Handschriften&lt;/u&gt; in 1931. His strong objection to Hitler's rise to power in 1933 resulted in his leaving Germany on political grounds in 1934, moving to Paris. There he researched and worked as an art dealer through 1939. He moved to Campione am Lugano, Switzerland that year as a private scholar and teacher, writing books (most notibly, one on Renaissance Merchants) and as a commissioned author for the Basel publisher Holbein-Verlag. The couple divorced around this time. He published a major monograph on the French Renaissance painter Jean Fouquet, &lt;u&gt;Jean Fouquet und seine Zeit&lt;/u&gt; in 1945. After the war, Wescher's career would be inextricably connected to his friend, the former Detroit Institute of Art director &lt;a href=\"/valentinerw\"&gt;Wilhelm (William) Valentiner&lt;/a&gt;. Valentiner had the Detroit Institute of Arts hire Wescher as a research associate at the Museum and Wescher immigrated to the United States in 1948. Wescher followed Valentiner as an assistant to Valentiner's postions at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. There, Wescher was picked in 1953 to be the director of the art collection the Oklahoma billionaire J. Paul Getty (1892-1976) was assembling in Santa Monica, CA. The collection at that time amounted to mostly second-rate baroque artists because of Getty's unwillingness to pay high prices for art, but a spectacular collection of French decorative art. He remarried again (Mary Wescher). He resigned from the Getty in 1959, working as a private researcher, curating exhibitions in the U.S., most notably, at the North Carolina Museum of Art under &lt;a href=\"/byrnesj\"&gt;James B. Byrnes&lt;/a&gt; (where Valentiner had been its first director) and at the New Orleans Museum of Art. He died at his California home in 1974. His research on the art-thefts of Napoleon was published posthumously in 1976.  Wescher was a scholar of Flemmish art though his principle book publication were in other areas. His book on Jean Fouquet was termed definitive by the &lt;u&gt;Burlington Magazine&lt;/u&gt;. He was among the generation of \"discovery art historians,\" whose numbers included &lt;a href=\"/bodew\"&gt;Wilhelm Bode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/friedlanderm\"&gt;Max Friedlí_nder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"/winklerf\"&gt;Friedrich Winkler&lt;/a&gt;, scholars who through stylistic analysis compiled oeuvre catalogs of artists establishing a body of work (Otten).</td>\n",

After receiving an &lt;em&gt;abitur&lt;/em&gt; from the Wiesbaden Realgymnasium in 1899, studied art history and Philosophy at Freiburg, Basel (under Heinrich A. Schmid, q.v.), Berlin and eventually again at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universití_t, Freiburg, where he was awarded his Ph.D. in 1907. His dissertation, written under Heinrich Wí_lfflin (q.v.), was on the topic of representation in medieval Italian art. Wichert joined the Stí_dtische Galerie under its director, Georg Swarzenski (q.v.). He married a Dutch woman, Margarete Brouwer (d. 1921) in 1908. Wichert contributed reviews to the &lt;u&gt;Frankfurter Zeitung&lt;/u&gt; as well. In 1909 he became director of the Kunsthalle in Mannheim, Germany where he set about purchasing French and German art of the 19th and 20th century. Among his famous purchases was the Manet painting \"The Execution of Maximilian.\" He hired the young Gustav Hartlaub (q.v.) as a curator in 1913. The two mounted many epoch-making exhibitions of modern art and founding an association for art (Freien Bundes zur Einbí_rgerung der Bildenden Kunst). After the death of his first wife, he married a woman of English/Jewish extraction, Margarete Wetzlar-Coit in 1922. The following year he was called to be director of the Stí_delschule in Frankfurt, the art school for the Stí_delsches Kunstinstitut, succeeded at Mannheim by Hartlaub. Wichert transformed the school into the most important arts-and-crafts technical school in Germany (Wendland). Between 1924 and 1930 he was involved with historic preservation for Wiesbaden. With the Nazi's rise to power in Germany in 1933, Wichert was denounced as a Bolshevik sympathizer for his modern art preferences. Pressures because of his wife's Jewish background (her father was a baptized British Jew) forced her and his daughter to flee to England. Wichert allowed her to divorce him and assume the name Wickham in order to spare them anti-German prejudice. Wichert himself retired to Keiten auf Sylt in 1934. After the war, Wichert was elected mayor of Kampen auf Sylt. His two marriages resulted in six children.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Michelangelo scholar and Deputy Director of the Courtauld Institute, professor 1950-58. Wilde was raised in Hungary. His parents were Richard Wilde (1840-1912) and Rosalie Somjíçgy (Wilde) (1854-1928). He attended the State Gymnasium in Budapest before the University of Budapest, 1909-1913 where he studied art, archaeology and philosophy, then one semester at the University of Freiburg before settling at the University of Vienna, 1915-1917. In Vienna he studied under Vienna-school scholar &lt;a href=\"/dvorakm\"&gt;Max Dvo»íçk&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he wrote his doctorate in 1918 on early Italian etching. Since 1914 he had been a volunteer at the department of prints at the Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest. In 1918 he was promoted to Assistant Curator at the Museum. There he was a member of the so-called Budapest Sunday Circle (Budapester Sonntagskreis) whose members included &lt;a href=\"/antalf\"&gt;Fredrick Antal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/hausera\"&gt;Arnold Hauser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/tolnayc\"&gt;Charles de Tolnay&lt;/a&gt;. In 1922 he moved permanently to Vienna where he was an assistant at the Gemí_ldegalerie of the Kunsthistorischen Museums, under the direction of the talented &lt;a href=\"/gluckg\"&gt;Gustav Glí_ck&lt;/a&gt;. In Vienna he collaborated with &lt;a href=\"/swobodak\"&gt;Karl Maria Swoboda&lt;/a&gt; in editing the collected works of Dvo»íçk. In 1923 he became Assistant Keeper, then Keeper of the Gemí_ldegalerie, where he was an early exponent of the use of x-rays for painting conservation. He became an Austrian citizen in 1928. In 1930 Wilde married the art historian Julia Gyíçrfíçs (d. 1970). Although Wilde was Roman Catholic, his Jewish wife was in jeopardy when the Nazis rose to power in 1933. The couple left for Holland in 1939 and then, as guests of &lt;a href=\"/clarkk\"&gt;Sir Kenneth Clark&lt;/a&gt; went to Aberystwyth, Wales, to consult for his former student, &lt;a href=\"/seilerundaspanga\"&gt;Count Antoine Seilern und Aspang&lt;/a&gt; on his collection. Wilde also assisted in cataloging the pictures of the National Gallery, where the London paintings were stored for safekeeping. Wilde was asked by the Keeper of Prints and Drawings &lt;a href=\"/pophama\"&gt;Arthur E. Popham&lt;/a&gt; of the British Museum to write a catalog of old master drawings at Windsor Castle in 1939. When World War II broke out, the Wilde's were interned and deported to an alien camp in Canada for the years 1940-1941, erroneously charged with signaling enemy submarines. They returned to England in 1941 where Wilde resumed his work on the Windsor Castle catalog. At the same time he began lecturing at the Courtauld Institute. He became a Reader in the History of Art there in 1947. The following year he advanced to Deputy Director of the Courtauld Institute of Art which he held until 1958. He was professor of History of Art beginning in 1950. He became emeritus in 1958. His students included &lt;a href=\"/shearmanj\"&gt;John Shearman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/borsooke\"&gt;Eve Borsook&lt;/a&gt;. Wilde published comparatively little and never allowed his lectures to be printed in his lifetime (his Michelangelo lectures appeared in 1978). Early on he was influenced by the work of the philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911), especially evident in Wilde's empirical approach to studying the object (Shearman). Wilde's scholarship on Michelangelo is some of his finest, his Windsor Castle collection catalog dispelled many myths about the artist. Wilde was an equal authority on Venetian art, a reputation he had already built during his years at the Gemí_ldegalerie in Vienna.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Iconologist specializing in the Renaissance era; and interdisciplinary art historian; first professor of art history at Oxford University. Wind learned classical languages along with French, English, and his native German at the Kaiser-Friedrich-Schule, a &lt;i&gt;humanistisches Gymnasium&lt;/i&gt; in Charlottenburg. He studied jointly philosophy and art history at various Germanic universities: three semesters in Berlin under &lt;a href=\"/goldschmidta\"&gt;Adolph Goldschmidt&lt;/a&gt;, one in Freiburg with Edmund Husserl (1859-1938) and Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), and Vienna with &lt;a href=\"/dvorakm\"&gt;Max Dvo»íçk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/schlosserj\"&gt;Julius von Schlosser&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"/strzygowski\"&gt;Josef Strzygowski&lt;/a&gt;. In 1920 he moved to the new university in Hamburg (begun in 1919) where he was the first student to write a dissertation under &lt;a href=\"/panofskye\"&gt;Erwin Panofsky&lt;/a&gt;, then a 28-year-old &lt;i&gt;privatdozent&lt;/i&gt;, and supervised by the philosopher/art historian &lt;a href=\"/cassirere\"&gt;Ernst Cassirer&lt;/a&gt;. His topic was on art-historical method. To escape the economic depression gripping Germany, Wind traveled to New York in 1924, initially staying with a cousin. He was appointed Graham Kenan Fellow in philosophy at the University of North Carolina, teaching there 1925-1927. Returning to Hamburg, Wind took a job as a research assistant at the Warburg Library, and wrote his &lt;i&gt;habilitation&lt;/i&gt; under Cassirer in philosophy, employing the philosophy of Charles Sanders Pierce (1839-1914), whose work he had read in America. Wind's initial methodological influence had been that of Cassirer through Panofsky, but his close personal relationship with &lt;a href=\"/warburga\"&gt;Aby Warburg&lt;/a&gt; brought him nearer to the \"cultural history\" approach of Warburg as well as the work of Pierce. Wind became a &lt;i&gt;privatdozent&lt;/i&gt; at Hamburg, 1930-1933. With the advent of Nazism in Germany, Wind, a Jew, played a key role in moving the Warburg library to London along with himself and, with &lt;a href=\"/wittkowerr\"&gt;Rudolf Wittkower&lt;/a&gt;, founded the &lt;u&gt; Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institute&lt;/u&gt; in 1937. Throughout the second World War, Wind taught at universities in the United States, (New York University, 1940-1942 and the University of Chicago, 1942-1944) and eleven years at Smith College, 1944-1955. In 1954 Wind was asked to deliver the Chichele Lectures at All Souls College, Oxford, on the topic \"Art and Scholarship under Julius II.\" These resulted in a 1955 appointment as the first Professorship of art history at Oxford (under the Faculty of Modern History). In 1960 Wind delivered radio lectures for the BBC, the Reith lectures, which later became his book &lt;u&gt;Art and Anarchy&lt;/u&gt;. His Oxford colleagues had difficulty appreciating Wind's philosophical propensities, his adulation of Cassierer and the post Hegelians (McConica). At Oxford he garnered the support of the classicist Richard Livingstone (1880-1960) (soon to be president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford) the medievalist Ernest Jacob (1894-1971), Chichele chair for medieval history All Souls College, and the classicist C. Maurice Bowra (1898-1971) of Wadham College. Wind also enjoyed the friendship of &lt;a href=\"/seznecj\"&gt;Jean Seznec&lt;/a&gt;, an art historian occupying the Marshall Foch Chair for french literature at All Souls College. Wind retired emeritus from Oxford in 1967. Though Wind was considered a classicist and Renaissance expert, he staunchly defended modern art, unlike many of his colleagues. Wind's name is most closely connected with his research in allegory and the use of pagan mythology during the 15th-16th centuries and his book of essays on the topic, &lt;u&gt;Pagan Mysteries of the Renaissance&lt;/u&gt;. In &lt;u&gt;Art and Anarchy&lt;/u&gt;, Wind argued that the height of art's powers to portray an idea had occurred in the Renaissance. The Romantic era's distrust that knowledge interfered with imagination had destroyed the acumen in modern viewers. Wind fits no traditional academic classification and is one of the prime examples of the intellectual tradition of Warburg's blend of mythological/psychological approach to art history. One of his students, &lt;a href=\"/hecksherw\"&gt;William S. Heckscher&lt;/a&gt;, referred to Wind as a \"magician\" for his brilliance as an art historian. His papers are housed at Oxford.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Scholar of Italian baroque art. Seminal figure for the generation of art historians who matured during the second half of the 20th century. Because Wittkower's father, Henry Wittkower (1865-1942), was British, the younger Wittkower held British citizenship his whole life despite having been born and raised in Germany. His mother was a German, Gertrude Ansbach (Wittkower) (1876-1965). After graduating from the humanistic Friedrichs Gymnasium in Berlin, Wittkower studied (practicing) architecture for a year in Berlin before deciding to changed to art history under &lt;a href=\"/wolfflinh\"&gt;Henrich Wí_lfflin&lt;/a&gt; in Munich. Wí_lfflin proved to be a very detached professor, and, unhappy with his teaching, Wittkower returned to Berlin to study under &lt;a href=\"/goldschmidta\"&gt;Adolph Goldschmidt&lt;/a&gt;. He completed his dissertation there on the subject of Domenico Morone. In 1923 he moved to Rome to assist &lt;a href=\"/steinmanne\"&gt;Ernst Steinmann&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Herziana, with completion of the &lt;u&gt;Michelangelo-Bibliographie 1510-1926&lt;/u&gt;. The same year he married Margot Holzmann (&lt;a href=\"/wittkowerm\"&gt;Margot Wittkower&lt;/a&gt;) who was to assist him with some of his later scholarship. In between, Wittkower contributed many entries for artists in the &lt;u&gt;Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden Kí_nstler&lt;/u&gt; (the so-called \"Thieme-Becker\"). He was elevated at the Biblioteca Herziana to a research fellow, remaining there until 1927. Wittkower returned to Berlin but continued his association with the Herziana, publishing in 1931 with &lt;a href=\"/bauerh\"&gt;Heinrich Brauer&lt;/a&gt; a survey of drawings by Bernini. The publication put him at the fore of an ideological battle (both esthetically and politically) with the major Austrian art historian, &lt;a href=\"/sedlmayrh\"&gt;Hans Sedlmayr&lt;/a&gt;. Sedlmayr criticized Wittkower in a published review, for belonging to neither of the two genres of art history that Sedlmayr found acceptable. The public exchange drew a distinction between Sedlmayer's &lt;i&gt;Gestaltungsprinzipien&lt;/i&gt; [abstract principles] approach to art history (as well as his anti-Jewish Nazi sympathies) and Wittkower's approach. After briefly teaching as a &lt;em&gt;Privatdozent&lt;/em&gt; at the Univeristy in Cologne in 1932-1933, Wittkower was forced to leave Germany--now fully under the control of the Nazis, whose laws forbade university positions to Jews--abandoning any &lt;em&gt;habilitationschrift&lt;/em&gt; for the London and the Warburg Institute. In London he was founding co-editor of the &lt;u&gt;Journal of the Warburg Institute&lt;/u&gt; (renamed in 1940 to &lt;u&gt;The Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes&lt;/u&gt;) in 1937, remaining at the Institute between 1934-1956. His position at the Institute allowed outside lecturing, such as his 1946 Courtauld Institute talks on the architecture of Vittone. Proof of his broad interests, when he first proposed the lectures to his host, &lt;a href=\"/blunta\"&gt;Anthony Blunt&lt;/a&gt;, Blunt believed Wittkower joking and had invented the architect's name. In 1948 the young Italian scholar &lt;a href=\"/salernol\"&gt;Luigi Salerno&lt;/a&gt; studied with Wittkower on a Warburg fellowship. Wittkower began publishing his research, first begun as his intended &lt;em&gt;habilitation&lt;/em&gt; in the 1930s, on Palladio and Alberti, in &lt;u&gt;Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes&lt;/u&gt;. These studies, expanded and broadened, were published in 1949 as his most significant book, &lt;u&gt;Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism&lt;/u&gt;. Formal pedagogical duties also began that year when he was appointed to be Durning Lawrence professor at the Slade School of Art, although these were limited largely to advising dissertations. Wittkower's dedication to drawings as a scholarly tool continued. He collaborated with several other eminent art historians to produce books on Sir Robert Mond's collection (with &lt;a href=\"/boreniust\"&gt;Tancred Borenius&lt;/a&gt;), drawings of Poussin (with Anthony Blunt, from a manuscript of &lt;a href=\"/friedlanderw\"&gt;Walter Friedlaender&lt;/a&gt;). In 1952 he published a catalog of Carracci drawings from Windsor Castle. Wittkower was visiting professor of art history at Harvard University in 1954. This solidified a move to the United States, where he became chair of the Department of Art History and Archaeology at Columbia University in 1956. In addition to lecturing at Columbia, Wittkower reorganized the Department, adding, among appointments, the first lecturer in Near Eastern art. Here, too, he wrote two of his most popular books, &lt;u&gt;Art and Architecture in Italy: 1600-1750&lt;/u&gt; (1958) and, in collaboration with his wife, &lt;u&gt;Born Under Saturn &lt;/u&gt;(1963). &lt;u&gt;Art and Architecture in Italy&lt;/u&gt;, volume 16 of the \"Pelican History of Art\" was (and remains) the publisher's best-selling volume of the series. A magisterial synthesis of a period of vast artistic output, Wittkower updated it three times. It received the Bannister Fletcher Prize for architectural writing. Wittkower retired from Columbia in 1969 as Avalon Foundation Professor Emeritus of Art History. During his final years, he held the Kress Professorship at the National Gallery of Art and Slade Professor at Cambridge. He delivered the Charles T. Mathews lectures for 1971-1972 which appeared as the book &lt;u&gt;Gothic vs. Classic: Architectural Projects in Seventeenth-century Italy&lt;/u&gt;. After his death he received Alice Davis Hitchcock Award in 1975. He supervised many Ph.D. dissertations including &lt;a href=\"/seklere\"&gt;Eduard Sekler&lt;/a&gt; (at the Warburg), &lt;a href=\"/pepperd\"&gt;D. Stephen Pepper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/rowec\"&gt;Colin Rowe&lt;/a&gt;. Another student also became a colleague of his at Columbia university, &lt;a href=\"/hibbardh\"&gt;Howard Hibbard&lt;/a&gt;, whose methodology Hibbard closely reflected. His scholarly tradition was most clearly continued in the work of &lt;a href=\"/connorsj\"&gt;Joseph Connors&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of method, Wittkower certainly differed from Sedlmayr. Compared to Sedlmayr's psychological-theoretic approach of the same material, Wittkower, in the words of &lt;a href=\"/clarkk\"&gt;Kenneth Clark,&lt;/a&gt; disposed of, \"the hedonist, or purely aesthetic, theory of Renaissance architecture.\" Not that Wittkower eschewed psychology (two of his books used this approach principally) rather, he preferred to allow documents to connect psychological patterns he used rather than vice versa. Like Goldschmidt, he discounted the Hegelian view of art history so common among German art historians of his and previous generations. &lt;a href=\"/krautheimerr\"&gt;Richard Krautheimer&lt;/a&gt; described Wittkower's art history as one blending mathematics and philosophy, the religious and cultural climate with the interrelations of patron and artist. Even the Warburg scholar &lt;a href=\"/saxlf\"&gt;Fritz Saxl&lt;/a&gt;, who admitted in a 1934 letter that Wittkower's ideas on the history of art were much different from his own, concluded that Wittkower's \"struggle for clear-shaped logical notions in art history has undoubted merits.\" &lt;u&gt;Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism&lt;/u&gt; remains his most influential writing, having immediately influenced works as disparate as &lt;u&gt;Die Kunst der Renaissance in Italien&lt;/u&gt; (1953) by &lt;a href=\"/paatzw\"&gt;Walter Paatz&lt;/a&gt;, Ezra Ehrenkrantz's &lt;u&gt;The Modular Number Pattern&lt;/u&gt; (1956) and P. H. Scholfield's The &lt;u&gt;Theory of Proportion in Architecture&lt;/u&gt; (1958). The book, however caught the scorn of &lt;a href=\"/paner\"&gt;Roberto Pane&lt;/a&gt; who attacked Wittkower's ideas at the Eighteenth International Congress of the History of Art (Venice) in 1956 (Wittkower, 1973). In 1961 Wittkower presented a paper at Winterthur, Delaware, on \"Art History as a Discipline\" which demonstrated his affinity for the work of &lt;a href=\"/panofskye\"&gt;Erwin Panofsky&lt;/a&gt; and decrying the extreme connoisseurship of &lt;a href=\"/fryr\"&gt;Roger Fry&lt;/a&gt;. The esthetician Joseph Masheck insightfully contrasted Panofsky with Wittkower, both fellow Warburg Institute scholars: \"Panofsky mainly pursued a history of illustrated concepts . . . that have taken roost . . . [in] datable objects.\" Wittkower, on the other hand, he contended, is the \"ultra-Warburgian,\" not limited to the classical tradition but employing a cosmopolitan view of art.</td>\n",

       "      <td>University of Uppsala professor 1965-1977. Zeitler's parents were Eugen Zeitler (1880-1922), an engineer, and Elsa Kí_hn (Zeitler) (1884-1922). Both parents were killed in a mountaineering accident in Berchtesgaden when Zeitler was ten; he was subsequently raised by his maternal grandfather in Kaiserslautern, Germany. He attended the Cologne and Kaiserslautern high schools (gymnasium) graduating in 1930. The same year he began study of history and art history in Munich, Marburg (under &lt;a href=\"/hamannr\"&gt;Richard Hamann&lt;/a&gt;), and Berlin. Because his mother was a converted Jew, Zeitler was forced to flee Germany after Hitler's rise to power in 1933. He first fled to Czechoslovakia in that year continuing study in Prague. He was granted a Ph.D. in history from Prague in 1936, writing a dissertation on Sophicles and the polis under Victor Ehrenberg (1891-1976). In 1937, pending the annexation of that country to Germany, Zeitler moved to Sweden, teaching in the Gymnasium in Uppsala. Zeitler found a mentor in the Uppsala University art historian &lt;a href=\"/paulssong\"&gt;Gregor Paulsson&lt;/a&gt;, publishing a monograph on Albrecht Dí_rer in 1946. He married Hannelore Gí_nthert (b. 1919), an historian, the following year. Zeitler published his habilitation, &lt;u&gt;Klassizismus und Utopia&lt;/u&gt;, written under Paulsson, in 1954. He taught as a privatdozent until his appointment as professor at the University in 1964. Zeitler used his classical education write on the comparatively neglected area of nineteenth-century Neo-classicism. He edited &lt;u&gt;Figura&lt;/u&gt; between 1965 and 1977. In 1966 he and Anders íman published a ground-breaking volume on nineteenth-century art in the &lt;u&gt;Propylí_en Kunstgeschichte&lt;/u&gt; series. Unlike many earlier surveys, it treated Neo-classicism as a significant art movement and not simply a dry precursor to Realism and Impressionism. He emphasized artistic theory of the era as a way to understand the art, an approach critized by some was ignoring truly popular taste. Zeitler eschewed the emerging post-war Warburg-school tradition of &lt;a href=\"/panofskye\"&gt;Erwin Panofsky&lt;/a&gt; that used iconographical interpretation. Instead he approached the period as a characteristic, multinational expression of its particular time in history (íman, &lt;u&gt;NZZ&lt;/u&gt; 2005). Zeitler's most important book, &lt;u&gt;Klassizismus und Utopia&lt;/u&gt;, emphasized Neo-classicism as the embodiment of significant bourgeois values, including utopian/dystopian views, which formed the basis for modern populist art. His rehabilitation of many neglected masterpieces of the years around 1800 marked an important revisionist approach to art history. His characterizing of the period as a dialectic, \"Kontrasterlebnis\" was adopted by other scholars of the nineteenth century, notably &lt;a href=\"/hofmannw\"&gt;Werner Hofmann&lt;/a&gt;. He personally viewed his work as a continuation of the German-Jewish tradition of scholarship (íman &lt;u&gt;NZZ&lt;/u&gt; 2005).</td>\n",

The younger Zucker attended the Wilhelms-Gymnasium, a humanities high school in Berlin where he graduated in 1907. He studied architecture at the Institute of Technology (Kí_nigliche Technische Hochschule) receiving the Diplom-Ingenieur in 1911 and Doktor-Ingenieurs in 1913 in the history of architecture under Richard Borrmann (q.v.). His dissertation was on the topic of pictorial space in Florentine painting. Between 1912-14 he was an assistant to Max Georg Zimmermann (q.v.) at the Schinkel Museum. He married the concert singer Rose Walter (1890-1962) in 1913. After a year teaching at the Reimann Schule in Berlin, 1914, Zucker joined the faculty in art history as a lecturer (Dozent) at the Lessing Hochschule, 1916-35. He practiced architecture in Berlin between 1919-35, much of it as a city planner. He lectured on architecture in radio broadcasts. His interest in stage design led to his association with avant-garde theatre groups. Among his commissions were the Prussian Bank and many country homes. Zucker was Dean of the Faculty at the Lessing Hochschule, 1930-33. In 1937 he was dismissed from his position by the Nazis because he was a Jew. His journal articles of those last years were sign with initials only to avoid recognition. Zucker emigrated to the United States the same year began teaching at the New School for Social Research in New York, then known as the \"University in Exile.\" He also lectured at the Fashion Institute, the Dramatic Workshop, and Pratt Institute, Brooklyn in the 1940s and 1950s. He remained at the New School until 1970. In 1938 he was appointed lecturer at the Cooper Union, then Adjunct Professor in 1948. He became an American citizen in 1944. In 1950 Zucker published his Styles in Art, a popular treatment of stylistic analysis in art. He retired in 1963 but retained Visiting Professor status 1964-1969 at the Cooper Union.   Zucker was interested in architectural space as a theoretical concept. He also wrote extensively on adult education in the arts.</td>\n",

       "1    Marxist/social-history art historian. Antal was born to a wealthy Jewish family. His father, Alajos Antal, was a medical doctor and his mother was Sofia Gerstl. The younger Antal completed a law degree in Budapest and then continued there as well as Freiburg and Paris to study art history. In studied in Berlin under <a href=\"/wolfflinh\">Heinrich Wí_lfflin</a> and then in Vienna under <a href=\"/dvorakm\">Max Dvoríçk</a>. He received his doctorate in art history in 1914 writing his thesis under Dvo»íçk on neoclassical and Romantic French painting. Antal volunteered in the Print Collection at the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest (1914/1915) cataloging the prints and drawings with <a href=\"/wildej\">Johannes Wilde</a>. In 1916 he joined the illustrious discussion group the <em>Sonntagskreis</em>, whose members included intellectuals such as the philosopher Georg Lukíçcs (1885-1971), the sociologist Karl Mannheim (1893-1947) and art historians <a href=\"/hausera\">Arnold Hauser</a> and Wilde. As World War I progressed, the Austro-Hungarian government, under whom he served, assigned him to Udine, Italy, to curate the art in this occupied territory. After the fall of the Empire, and the creation of the Hungarian Soviet Republic (March 21, 1919), Antal became <i>Vorsitzender des Direktoriums</i> (Chairman of the Board) at the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest, where he assisted in opening the museum's private collection to the public and organizing a successful exhibition with the help of museum director <a href=\"/benescho\">Otto Benesch</a>. As <i>Vorsitzender</i> of the museum, Antal headed efforts to promote artists and protect national monuments. His tenure ended abruptly after the Counterrevolution of summer 1919, which forced him to flee first to Florence and then to Vienna. Partially funded by the University of Berlin, Antal traveled extensively in Italy between 1919 and 1923, spending most of his time in Florence. He completed his magnum opus, a history of sixteenth-century Florentine painting in the 1920s, but declined to publish it. He had, in the meantime, become enamored with a Marxist dialectical theory of history, but also, with the realization that any writing about late Italian painting (\"Mannerism\") depended upon a thorough understanding to the fifteenth-century revolution which was the early Renaissance (Blunt). He married Theodora von Lobell (later divorced). The years 1923 to 1933 Antal spent as a resident of Berlin, where he collaborated with Bruno Fí_rst (1891-1965) as editor (1926-1934) of the periodical <u>Kritische Berichte zur kunstgeschichtlichen Literatur</u>, a publication primarily concerned with methodology. In Berlin his interest was primarily on Italian sixteenth-century painting. In 1932 Antal toured Soviet museums, about which he later lectured (published 1976). The rise of the Nazi regime in Germany in 1933 forced him, as a Jew, to flee again, this time to England, where he was befriended by the art historian <a href=\"/blunta\">Anthony Blunt</a>. In 1936 he remarried, now to Evelyn Foster (b. 1903/4), a British citizen, and Oxford graduate. Antal spent his first years in England rewriting his Florentine art history to incorporate his earlier findings and social-history approached. He lectured at the Courtauld Institute and became a naturalized citizen in 1946. Finally, in 1948, his reworked text was published as the book <u>Florentine Painting and its Social Background: the Bourgeois Republic before Cosimo de Medici's Advent to Power: Fourteenth and Early Fifteenth Centuries</u> in England. His research on drawing at the Royal Library at Windsor Castle, were incorporated into the 1949 catalog by <a href=\"/pophama\">A. E. Popham</a> and Wilde. The same year he published \"Remarks on the Method of Art History\" his new-found credo on art-historical method. Thereafter, Antal's interests shifted from French classical/romantic painting to the 18th-century British artists Hogarth and Fí_ssli. He died at his Marlborough Place home in 1954. His manuscripts on Hogarth and Fí_ssli were published posthumously. His collected essays, <u>Classicism and Romanticism, with other Studies in Art History</u>, published 1966, contained some of his best writing, articles.  Antal's methodology can be seen as blending that of <a href=\"/warburga\">Aby Warburg</a> with a more traditional Marxist view of art. In his later writings, he increasingly applied the concept of Marxist dialectical materialism to art history. He suggested that the concept of artistic style is primarily an expression of ideology, political beliefs and social class. This methodology has been criticized as assuming too strong a determination of artistic style by social constructs. Antal was also criticized for defining an artist's identity too narrowly by his patron or benefactor's social class and thereby neglecting the artist's subjectivity. The review of <u>Florentine Painting</u> by <a href=\"/meissm\">Millard Meiss</a> in the <u>Art Bulletin</u> (1949) is most illuminating, both toward Antal's methodology and of the art establishment's reaction of his work. Antal's Marxist beliefs and reputation as politically a Communist effectively excluded from the Western academic world after 1948. His books following <u>Florentine Painting</u> were less imbued with this methodology. After his death, his social-history Marxist style became more popular and appreciated. The critic and art historian <a href=\"/bergerj\">John Berger</a> cited Antal as a major influence on Berger's work and the medievalist <a href=\"/grodeckil\">Louis Grodecki</a> in the 1970s acknowledged Antal's important study on competing Florentine monastic orders in architectural commissions. Blunt ascribed to Antal one of the earliest art historians to clearly define the term \"Mannerism\" and particularly Fí_ssli's relationship to the earlier movement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2    Philosopher of perception and art; used Gestalt psychology for his art-historical studies. Arnheim was the son of Georg Arnheim (1867-1944), a piano factory owner, and Betty Gutherz (Arnheim) (1879-1966). He was raised in Berlin, attending the Herdergymnasium (Abitur 1923). His parents intended him to assume the family business, but beginning in 1923 Arnheim, studied art and music history, philosophy and psychology at the University of Berlin with Gestalt-based scholars Wolfgang Kí_hler (1887-1967) and Kurt Lewin (1890-1947). His Ph.D. dissertation was supervised by the eminent theorist Max Wertheimer (1880-1943) in 1928. Arnheim became friends and was greatly influenced by the private art historian Kurt Badt (q.v.); his sister, Helen \"Leni\" Arnheim (1906-1973) married Badt. Arnheim pursued his interests in the arts through the editorship of <u>Die Weltbuhne</u>, a leftist magazine of politics and culture, publishing articles on film, art and architecture. This led him to develop his theories of the primacy of perception in art appreciation, linking it with the heretofore separated function of mental cognition. His investigations included music and film (he was one of the first to publish a book on the artistic aspects of the silent film in 1932). He married Annette Siecke (later divorced). While interviewing the Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl (1902-2003) on the radio, she prophetically warned him, \"As long as the Jews are film critics, I'll never have a success.\" Hitler's rise in Germany meant Arnheim had to flee Jewish persecution, initially to Rome. He spent five years as associate editor for a League of Nations cultural publication before Mussolini allied himself with Hitler and Arnheim again had to move. He traveled to England working as a translator for the BBC. In 1940 he immigrated to the United States. He lectured at the New School for Social Research (influencing, among others, the first American Africanist <a href=\"/sieberr\">Roy Sieber</a>) and then Columbia University, working as a researcher involved with the habits of radio listeners. Arnheim was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for the 1942-1943 year. He began teaching at Sarah Lawrence College in 1943, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1946. Arnheim married a second time to Mary Frame (1918-1999), a librarian, in 1953. He published his best known work, <u>Art and Visual Perception</u>, a theory of graphic understanding, in 1954. In 1962, Arnheim wrote a work of true art history, <u>Picasso's Guernica: The Genesis of a Painting</u>. In it, he traces the elements of the famous Picasso work and how they combine to create the meaning generally accepted today. Arnheim was appointed to Harvard University, Carpenter Center of Visual Arts, in 1968. He retired from Harvard in 1974, emeritus professor of the psychology of art. He continued as a visiting professor at the University of Michigan retiring a second time in 1984. At age 102 he contracted pneumonia at his Ann Arbor retirement community and died. Methodologically, Arnheim was fascinated by the perceptual structures in appreciating art. His investigations in the preliminary sketches for Picasso's Guernica, among other works, helped establish a revised view of art interpretation for many art historians. His pioneering notion of \"Visual thinking,\" the idea that vision itself is the primary modality for thought, is the driving force behind his books. His views on art harken to the empiricist philosophy of John Locke (1632-1704), who asserted that knowledge of the world is an objective sensory experience. Arnheim's view was criticized by, among others, the literary philosopher Richard Rorty (1931-2007) (who ironically died the day before Arnheim).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "4    Art historian of Italian renaissance. Auerbach studied art history in Hamburg with the so-called Hamburg School art historians Charles de Tolnay (q.v.), Fritz Saxl (q.v.), Aby Warburg (q.v.) and Erwin Panofsky (q.v.). She wrote her dissertation under Panofsky on Andrea del Sarto in 1932. She married one of the first Bauhaus school students, the sculptor and graphic artist Johannes Auerbach (changed to John Allenby in England,1900-1950) and immigrated to England in 1938. Auerbach never practiced art history after her immigration, but contributed to the festschrift on on Walter Friedlaender, 1933.

       "6    Private scholar; art historian of the baroque and modern periods; methodological theorist. Badt was born to a prosperous Banking family in Berlin. His father, Leopold Badt (1858-1929) raised his children in a rarefied cultural atmosphere, giving them every opportunity to experience art. The younger Badt attended the Berlin-Charlottenburg Reformgymnasium, graduating in 1906. Between 1909-1914 he studied art history and philosophy at the universities of Berlin, Munich and finally at Freiburg (im Breisgau) under <a href=\"/vogew\">Wilhelm Ví_ge</a>. While a student, Badt took a young <a href=\"/panofskye\">Erwin Panofsky</a> to hear a lecture by Ví_ge and thus cementing one of the most famous pupil/teacher relationships in art history. Badt's doctoral thesis, written in 1914, was on the Renaissance painter Andrea Solario. He never wrote a <i>habilitation</i> or taught professionally until nearly his retirement. Badt began his career as an assistant at the Bremen Kunsthalle, studying studio painting and sculpture. Throughout his career, his art-historical writing always reflected a painter's interest in details and their relationship to the world. He married Ella C. Wollheim around this time. Badt taught privately at Ludwigshafen/Bodensee, lecturing on the philosophy of G. F. W. Hegel (1770-1831), Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911) and Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), the latter whom he knew personally. His early writings in the 1920s included contemporary artists, such as Wilhelm Lehmbruck. His first marriage dissolved, Badt married Helen \"Leni\" Arnheim (1906-1973), the sister of the esthetician and art historian <a href=\"/arnheimr\">Rudolf Arnheim</a>. With the ascension of the Hitler's party in Germany in 1933, Badt moved to Munich in anonymity to avoid Nazi persecution. Although a declared Roman Catholic, Badt's Jewish heritage eventually forced him to flee Nazi Germany at the outbreak of World War II in 1939. He gained a research position at the newly founded Warburg Institute in London, remaining there until after the war. In 1946 he published <u>EugíÂne Delacroix Drawings</u>, his first book since the partial publication of his thesis in 1914. Badt returned to Germany in 1950 and became a German citizen in 1952, assisting with the reorganization of the university system. The post-war German period of his life resulted in his greatest publishing output. In 1961 Badt issued a series of essays (some previously published) on Jan Vermeer which outlined Badt's methodology '<u>Modell und Maler' von Vermeer</u>, but also pointedly criticizing the methodology of 'second Vienna school' art historian <a href=\"/sedlmayrh\">Hans Sedlmayr</a>. Sedlmayr, perhaps staunchest supporter of Nazism to retain an art history professorship after World War II, argued for a pseudo-scientific theoretic approach to art. Ever rooted in the object, Badt's <u>Vermeer</u> attacked Sedlmayr on methodological grounds. In 1968 he was invited by literary theorist Hans Robert Jauss (1921-1997) to the newly founded University of Constance (Konstanz). Badt's work greatly influenced the art historians Gertrude Berthold (b. 1920), the Sedlmayr student <a href=\"/dittmannl\">Lorenz Dittmann</a>, <a href=\"/gosebruchm\">Martin Gosebruch</a>, <a href=\"/grossw\">Werner Gross</a>, <a href=\"/schmollj\">Josef Adolf Schmoll <em>genannt</em> Eisenwerth </a>and <a href=\"/imdahlm\">Max Imdahl</a>. Despondent in old age, Badt committed suicide at 83. Badt regarded art as a portrait of reality (<i>Wirklichkeitsdarstellung)</i>. Of particular interest to him was the subject matter of the work and meaning of colors in paintings. This method lent itself best to the artists he studied: Nicolas Poussin, Jan Vermeer, John Constable, EugíÂne Delacroix, Paul Cí©zanne, Vincent van Gogh and Paolo Veronese. Badt considered the \"masterpiece\" to be the only art worth studying. Among his appreciators, Jauss, (1975) praised him for mentioning human suffering in his works, often forgotten by other historical works. W. Eugene Kleinbauer characterized him as \"too rigid for analysis.\" Badt's art history owes much to Johann Gustav Droysen's <u>  Historik</u> (1868). Badt wrote about the distinction between art history and its political, social and economic implications. He questioned deeply rooted principles of art history as had Heinrich Wí_lfflin (q.v). Since he was writing against the norm, other art historians often portrayed as a traitor and his understanding of art was questioned. His writings and methodology sparked greatest interest in fields outside art history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "8    Expert in the German Art of the Middles Ages. Baum studied art history at the universities of Munich, Berlin and Tí_bingen, where he worked under Karl Voll (q.v.) and Heinrich Wí_lfflin (q.v). He completed his dissertation in Tí_bingen in 1905 on the churches of the architect Heinrich Schickhardt (1558-1634) under Konrad Lange (q.v.). Baum wrote his habilitation under Heinrich Weizsí_cker (q.v.) in Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart. In 1911 his work on <u>Ulmer Plastik um 1500</u>, caught the attention of the scholars Paul Clemen (q.v), Jakob Ritter von Falke (q.v) and Philipp Halm (1854-1923) at the Technische Hochschule. He taught art history there until 1924. Except for voluntary service in World War I, Baum worked between 1908-23 first as an assistant and then conservator at the Wurtemberg Office for Historic Conservation (Wí_rttembergischen Amt fí_r Denkmalpflege) and at the state museum in Stuttgart. Out of this work he published the catalog <u>Deutschen Bildwerke des 10.-18. Jahrhunderts</u> (1931). In 1924 Baum was called to be the director of the museum at Ulm. There he dedicated himself to the history of local art and artists. He married Emma Gruner (1893-1970), a protestant woman, in 1929. In 1930 he published the final volume in the series of <u>Handbuchs des Kunstwissenschaft,</u> which was the first survey of the history of paintings and sculpture of the north Alps in the Middle Ages. After his dismissal in 1933 he was invited by Johnny Roosval (q.v.) of the University of Stockholm to lecture in the Winter semester of 1935. His lectures were published in 1937 in Paris as <u>La sculpture figurale en Europe íæ l'í©poque mí©rovingienne</u>. Back in Stuttgart as a private art historian, Baum was arrested by the Gestapo in 1938 as a Jew and taken to the concentration camp at Welzheim. Authorities at a museum in Bern rescued him in 1939, enabling a move to Switzerland. He lived in Switzerland until the end of World War II working for the state archive in Lucerne researching medieval sculptors. In 1946 Baum returned to Germany at the invitation of the minister of culture Theodor Heuss (1884-1963). Baum was enlisted in the rebuilding of German castles between 1947-1952.  In his research on medieval Bavarian art, Bauch analyzed the development of styles and iconography of the Middle Ages. Baum understood style questions as matters of time, dissociated from at the trend toward a \"scientific approach to art\" which became vogue in the 1920s (led by Kurt Gerstenberg (q.v), Wilhelm Pinder (q.v), Oskar Hagen (q.v), Eugen Kurt Fischer) which related artistic epochs to among other things, ethnic peoples. Chief among these in the speculation was the gothic, which Baum regarded as an element of the era, not of a people. Typical of the form-analytic generation of art historians, Baum, saw the development of art in the context of the culture and history of ideas, a notion he adopted from Jakob Burckhardt (q.v.). In <u>Zwí_lf deutsche Dome des Mittelalters</u><i> </i>(1955) he examined individual buildings and their sculptural decoration in the context of their respective social conditions in the cities and dioceses. The self-sufficiency of the German buildings were stressed, contrasting French and Italian reliance on the antique. The wall treatment became a key notion for Baum.

       "9    Early collector of Egon Schiele, wrote a memoir of the artist. Benesch was a railroad administrator in Vienna for the southern line. Although the position was not a particularly lucrative one, he collected contemporary Austrian art. Early on he befriended the Austrian expressionist artist Egon Schiele and became one of his earliest patrons. Schiele painted a combined portrait of him and his son in 1913 (<u>Doppelbildnis H. Benesch und Sohn</u>, Neue Galerie der Stadt Linz, Wolfgang Gurlitt Museum, Inventory 12). In 1943, after his son's exile, Benesch wrote a brief memoir of his experience with Schiele. Benesch's son was an eminent art historian Otto Benesch (q.v.), whose wife published the manuscript in 1965.

       "10   Rembrandt scholar and director of the Albertina 1947-61. Benesch's father was the art collector Heinrich Benesch (q.v.). Among the elder Benesch's friends was the Austrian Expressionist Egon Schiele. A double portrait of father and son, painted by Schiele in 1913, is owned by the Wolfgang-Gurlitt-Museum in Linz, Austria. The younger Benesch studied art history at the University of Vienna and a semester in Stockholm under Johnny Roosval (q.v.). Around 1919 he assisted Friedrick Antal (q.v.) in organizing the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest. Benesch wrote his dissertation in Vienna under Max Dvo»íçk in 1921 on the subject of Rembrandt's drawings. Between 1919-23 he was a volunteer assistant at the picture gallery (Gemí_ldegalerie) at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, under director of Gustav Glí_ck (q.v.). In 1923 he was appointed assistant curator at the Graphische Sammlung Albertina. There he met Eva Steiner, an administrative clerk, and married her in 1934. In 1935 he wrote the twelve-page (!) entry on Rembrandt for the <u>Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden Kí_nstler</u> (Thieme-Becker). With the annexation of Austria by the Nazis in 1938, the Benesches fled (Eva, although protestant, was of Jewish extraction). Traveling by way of Switzerland, Benesch moved to France and then, in 1939, was a guest lecturer in the Netherlands. The academic year 1939-40 he spent in England, where he was briefly interned on the Isle of Man at the outbreak of World War II. At the invitation of Walter W. S. Cook (q.v.), Benesch lectured at New York University, and in 1941 at Harvard University with the assistance of a Guggenheim Fellowship supplied by Wilhelm Koehler (q.v.). During the war he and Eva worked for the American Defense, Harvard Group, identifying art monuments in Austria and Czechoslovakia. In 1945 he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. It was in 1945 that he first published his <u>The Art of the Renaissance in Northern Europe</u>. The book owes much to Dvo»íçk, especially the expansion of the Dvo»íçkian concept of Mannerism to northern artists such as Bruegel (Posner). In 1946 he was called back to Vienna, where he assumed the Director of the Albertina in 1947, a position he held until 1962. He was named Associate Professor of Art History at the University of Vienna in 1948. His years as director focused on acquisitions that broadened the scope of the Albertina's collections. Between 1954-57 Benesch published the first complete catalog of Rembrandt drawings, based on much original research. Benesch's area of scholarship was graphic arts and particularly Rembrandt.  His publications reflect his wide interests, covering gothic art, conservation of monuments, art theory and musicology (he was an organist and keyboard musician). Methodologically, Benesch was not wedded to theory, such as fellow Vienna-school historians Otto Pí_cht (q.v.), Dagobert Frey (q.v.) and Hans Sedlmayr (q.v.). Instead, he employed the <i>Geistesgeschichte</i> approach of documentary/intellectual history akin to the work of his mentor Dvo»íçk. He and Hans Tietze (q.v.) were among Dvo»íçk's most important pupils.

       "11   Modernist art historian and art librarian, professor University of Kansas. Berger studied art history under Heinrich Wí_lfflin (q.v.), Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.), Graf Vitzthum von Eckstí_dt (q.v.) and Paul Frankl (q.v.) at the respective universities of Munich, Berlin, Heidelberg and Gí_ttingen. He completed his dissertation under Moritz Geiger in aesthetics at Gí_ttingen in 1925, his topic addressing Wí_lfflin's methodology. From 1926-28 was an assistant and one of the earliest collaborators at the Warburg Library in Hamburg, under Fritz Saxl (q.v.). He was a lecturer on art at the University of Berlin Extension, Berlin, between 1927-33 and head librarian at the Berlin Municipal Libraries, Berlin, 1929-1933. With the advent of the Nazi party's authority in 1933, Berger was forced to flee Germany, not because of religion (he was from a protestant family) but because of his profile in the Social Democratic party. He went first to France were he worked as a library assistant at the BibliothíÂque Nationale, lecturing on art (1936-1939) at an independent German-speaking school there. Just before the Nazi invasion of France, he secured an emergency visa to the United States, emigrating in 1941. He taught at Northwestern University as a lecturer on art, 1943-1945. As the war was winding down in Europe, Berger joined the U.S. Army University and returned to France at Biarritz, as a professor of art in 1945. He switched to the U.S. Military Government of Bavaria (OMGUS), where, as an officer, he worked in the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Section for 1946. After war service he joined the University of Kansas City (now the University of Missouri at Kansas City), as an assistant professor of art (1947-1950) moving to the University of Kansas, Lawrence in 1950 as an assistant professor, eventually rising to professor of art history. He retired in 1970 and resettled in France.Berger's 1952 book on Gí©ricault, the first modern biography of the artist, demonstrates Berger's methodology as an art historian. Downplaying the dominant view of Gí©ricault as motivated by the Romantic movement, Berger emphasized the artist's political commitment. His quasi-Marxist approach, one reviewer remarked, follows that of Frederick Antal (q.v.). Indeed, Berger's brother was a prominent communist in pre-war Germany. Berger's interest was on reinterpreting the artist, rather than a discovery of new documents. The popularity of his approach--Berger employed Freudian analysis for a number of pictures--is demonstrated by the book's rapid translation into both French and English. However, Berger's emphasis on reinterpretation was at the cost of scrutiny of the original work. In a caustic reply to the Germain Seligman (q.v.) review of Berger's book in the <u>Art Bulletin</u>, Lorenz Eitner (q.v.) took Berger to task for accepting works as autograph which even then were suspect. The fact that Berger validated a painting in Seligman's gallery only added to the apparent impropriety.

       "12   Museum curator, authority on early Christian, Byzantian, Islamic and early Nordic art and textiles. Berliner's parents were Theodor Berliner, a protestant from Jewish extraction, who owned a factory, and Philippine Wollner (Berliner). Beginning in 1904, Berliner studied art history in Berlin, Heidelberg and Vienna under <a href=\"/dvorakm\">Max Dvo»íçk</a>, earning his doctorate in 1910 with a dissertation on the dating of a Greek manuscript miniature painting. He joined the Bavarian National Museum (Bayerischen Nationalmuseum) in Munich in 1912, working there until 1935 except for War service (1914-1918). He was chief curator at the museum from 1926. In 1933 Berliner, because of his Jewish heritage, was interned in the concentration camp in Dachau, but released after two years later through the initiative of two of his colleagues, the art historian Hans Buchheit (1878-?) and collector Eugen Brí_schwiler. He was nonetheless dismissed from the Museum on \"racial\" grounds, accusations of which he had previously escaped during the initial 1933 purge because of his extensive war service. Between 1935-1939, he lived in the Alps near Berchtesgaden, until he was finally forced to emigrate. In the United States, Berliner worked at the Museum of Arts of Decoration of Cooper Union (1939-1946), the Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Fine Arts (1946-1953), and at the Textile Museum in Washington DC from 1962 until his re-emigration to Germany in 1967. In the 1950s, Berliner taught the museum course at NYU's Institute of Fine Arts. Berliner was an authority on textile arts and ivory but also wrote on Christian iconography (notably representations of creches) and the 18th century Giuseppe Barberi (1746-1809). <a href=\"/ettinghausenr\">Richard Ettinghausen</a>, in his introduction to Berliner's bibliography, notes that Berliner did not limit himself to \"great\" topics of art history but rather concerned himself with facts, fighting all superficial interpretation, turning his attention to the marginal and to everyday objects often considered only <i>curiosa</i> by established art historians. A strong personality, he remained respected by the academic community for the novel insights which his scholarship provided.

       "14   Medievalist art historian and professor; wrote on phenomenology. Bernheimer was born into a prominent family of art dealers, <i>Bernheimer of Munich</i>. In the early 20th century, the firm was one of the most important dealerships in precious materials, antiquities, Gobelins and oriental carpets. Between 1925-30, Bernheimer studied art history (both Western and Oriental) as well as archeology in Munich, Berlin and Rome with Wilhelm Pinder (q.v.), Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.), August Liebmann Mayer (q.v.), Hans Kauffmann (q.v.), Werner Weisbach (q.v.) and Hans Hildebrandt (q.v.). His dissertation, written under Pinder, was on Roman animal sculpture and its originating motives. Between the time of graduation and the Nazi assumption of power in 1933, he apparently taught privately and worked in the family business. Of Jewish extraction, Bernheimer was forced to flee Germany in 1933, securing a position at The University of Pennsylvania teaching undergraduates. Between 1933 and 1958 was respectively lecturer, Assistant Professor, and Associate Professor (1942) at Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges, also serving in the US army during the World War II. In 1951 he was appointed full professor. He spent the year 1941 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He committed suicide in Portugal at age 50. His son, Charles Bernheimer (1942-1998), was a noted scholar of Comparative Literature and Multicultural Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. Bernheimer's life interest was in Oriental influences on the west, but his publications were wide ranging. His most important book, <u>Wild Men in  the Middle Ages</u> (1952), reflects his willingness to delve deeply into folklore and history to write a highly original and respected book. Known as well for an interest in mathematics, music and theology, <u>Wild Men</u> looked at fertility rites involving the staged capture of \"wild men\" in medieval Europe. His research allowed him to come up with compelling interpretations of beasts in medieval and reniassance art that had puzzled other scholars such as Erwin Panofsky (q.v.). An enthusiastic teacher, his positive lecturing style was noted by many of his students.

His dissertation, written under Wí_lfflin, was on the early work of his home town's most famous artist, Tilman Riemenschneider. It was granted in 1924 and published the following year. Between 1924-1930 Bier he began publishing his magisterial book on Riemenschneider while lecturing (Dozent) at the Volkschule. He also contributed articles on modern architecture. In 1931 he married the art historian Senta Dietzel (1900-1978), whose brother was the gallery owner Max Dietzel, a sponsor of the Kí_nstlergruppe Brí_cke shows and other modern art. From 1930-36 Bier was a curator of the Kestner Society and Museum in Hannover which mounted contemporary art exhibitions. Bier himself collected the work of Bauhaus artists Paul Klee, Oskar Schlemmer and Lyonel Feininger. In 1936 the Nazi government closed the Kestner Society and banished Bier, who was Jewish. Bier withdrew first to upper Bavaria and then, in 1937 immigrated to the United States. His former classmate, Richard Krautheimer (q.v.) recommended Bier for the position he was vacating at the University of Louisville, Kentucky. Bier taught art history there 1937-60, acting as Chair of the department 1946-60. While Chair at Louisville, he founded the Allen R. Hite Institute. He was a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, during the year 1953-54, and visiting professor at the Freie Universití_t, Berlin in 1956 and a Fulbright lecturer in Wí_rzburg, 1960-61. He supplied over two hundred pieces of art criticism for the Louisville <u>Courier Journal</u>. In 1960, Bier was appointed to be the second director of the state art museum in North Carolina, replacing the late Wilhelm Valentiner (q.v.). He functioned as director of the North Carolina Museum of art until his retirement in 1970. His papers are housed at the University of Louisville where an endowed chair is named for him. Bier was a connoisseur-scholar who's research focused principally on gothic and renaissance architecture and sculpture.  He was an exponent of modern art and architecture and was friends with many Bauhaus architects (including Mies van der Rohe).

       "16   Early Warburg Institute developer and Director. Bing's parents were Moritz Bing and Emma Jonas (Bing). After attending the Lyceum in Hamburg, 1909-1913 and receiving an <i>abitur</i> from the Heinrich-Hertz Realgymnasium in 1916, she attended the universities of Munich and then Hamburg concentrating in philosophy. Her dissertation, written under Ernst Cassirer (q.v.) in 1921, focused on Lessing and Leibniz. The following year she began working as a librarian at the Warburg Library (Kulturwissenschaflichen Bibliothek Warburg or \"KBW\"), founded by Aby Warburg (q.v.), who was then hospitalized for a mental condition. She would be associated with various aspects of the Warburg the rest of her life. In 1924 Bing became Warburg's personal research assistant. Together with Fritz Saxl (q.v.) the three became the Warburg Institute of those early years. The KBW officially opened in 1926. She effectively became the director in 1927. At Warburg's death in 1929, Bing edited his <u>Gesammelten Schriften</u>. With the Nazi rise to power in 1933, the KBW, founded by and named for a Jew, fell from official favor. Together with Saxl, who was now Bing's life partner, the two moved the KBW to London as the Warburg Institute. The Institute was headed by Saxl with assistance and lecturing by Henri Frankfort (q.v.), with Bing as assistant Director. Saxl and Bing worked tirelessly to sponsor and find jobs for art historians fleeing Nazi Germany. At the beginning of World War II, Bing drove an ambulance in Britain as part of t he London Auxilliary Ambulance Service until she was dismissed as an \"enemy alien.\" Saxl and Bing's home in Dulwich was open to many scholars throughout their career, including the young art historian couple from New York University, Harry Bober (q.v.) and Phyllis Pray Bober (q.v.). In 1948 Saxl died and was succeed as director by Frankfort. Bing succeeded Frankfort at his death in 1954, lecturing at the University of London as the Professor of the History of the Classical Tradition. Bing fell ill while working at the Institute in 1964 and died a month later.

       "17   Byzantine and Russian art specialist, later historian of 19th- and 20th-century painting (U.S. career). Born's parents were Gustav Born (1850-1900), a professor of anatomy and embryology at the University in Breslau, and Berthe Lipstein (Born). Born served in World War I in the sanitary corps. After the war he married Susi Bial in 1918 studying studio art at schools between 1919-1923 in Munich and under ídouard Vuillard in Paris. As an artist, Born issued a series of lithographs in 1921 to illustrate the 1912 novella <u>Der Tod in Venedig</u> (Death in Venice) by Thomas Mann (1875-1955). Mann so approved of the art that he wrote Born, revealing for the first time that the protagonist was drawn from the composer Gustav Mahler (1860-1911). Born moved to Vienna the same year, divorcing Bial in 1925. In Vienna he worked as a free-lance journalist, book illustrator, radio art critic and extension professor at the Volkshochschule. He turned to art history in 1928, attending classes at the universities of Munich, under <a href=\"/wolfflinh\">Heinrich Wí_lfflin</a> and Vienna under <a href=\"/strzygowski\">Josef Stryzgowski</a>. Born wrote his dissertation under Strzygowski in 1931 on the topic of animal representation in interlace design of illustrated books. He worked briefly as an expertizer at the Dorotheum in Vienna, but the rise of the Nazis in Germany in 1933 prevented further publishing there (though Roman Catholic, he was of Jewish extraction). Shortly before the annexation of Austria by the Third Reich, Born emigrated to the United States in 1937 to avoid persecution. In the United States he secured a job as Art Director at Maryville College, St. Louis, MO, teaching art and art history. He became a U.S. citizen in 1943. The following year he moved to New York, taking a position at Queens College, New York, then professor of Art History at Louisiana State University, New Orleans, 1945-1948. Born wrote the obituary for Wí_lfflin in the <u>College Art Journal</u> in 1945. In Louisiana Born married a second time to Mary Mercer in 1946. He returned to New York in 1948 as professor of art history at Hunter College (City University of New York). The same year Born published <u>American Landscape Painting; an Interpretation</u>, which brought to the attention of the American reading public the importance of American art (Wickiser). He suffered a heart attack and died in 1949. Born's half brother (through his father's first marriage) was the Nobel-prize-winning physicist Max Born (1882-1970). Born's publications were largely journal articles, ranging from the scholarly to the non-art publications. From Strzygowski, he drew an appreciation of psychological aspects of art, publishing articles in art in several psychology journals. He had begun to publish monographs in his new-found area of American art at the time of his death.

Breitenbach studied art history as well as German and Scandinavian literature at the university in Munich and then Hamburg where his professors were Erwin Panofsky (q.v.) and Fritz Saxl (q.v.). His dissertation, completed in Strassburg in 1929 under Panofsky, was <u> Speculum humanae salvationis: eine typengeschichtliche Untersuchungen</u>. He worked as a Library assistant at the Warburg Library in Hamburg 1926-27. Between 1927-29 he studied library sciecne in Gí_ttingen and Berlin, working until 1933 in the Frankfurt Stadtbibliothek. That year he was dismissed by the Nazis through their <i>Gesetzes zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums</i> law, removing jews (Breitenbach though Christian, was of Jewish extraction) from the civil service. Between 1933-37 he lived in Basel and London. In 1937 he emigrated to the United States in 1937. In 1943 he became an American citizen, working the Federal Communications Commission monitoring German radio broadcasts. Between 1944-45 he was Chief of Documentary Operations in the Office of War Information in Washington, DC. After the war, he returned to Germany with Office of Military Government-Unitded States (OMGUS) in 1945 in Berlin. Between the years 1946-49 he worked in the Central Art Collection Point in Munich (in the former NSDAP party headquarters) as the Museum and Fine Arts officer researching the provenance of misappropriated Nazi art. He was, under Craig Hugh Smyth (q.v.), one of the founders of the Zentralinstitut(s) fí_r Kunstgeschichte. He worked in the American High Commission in Bad Neuheim and Frankfurt between 1949-53, in the Cultural Relations Division, Section for Fine Arts, Museums, Libraries and Archives reconstructing German libraries. In 1956 he returned to Washington, DC, where he was head of the Prints and Photographs division of the Library of Congress in Washington. He retired in 1973. He died on a visit to Germany in 1977.

       "19   University of Toronto professor and early Courtauld Institute scholar. Brieger was born to Oskar Brieger, (d. 1914), an otolaryngologist and Hedwig Lion. He grew up in this affluent family under the tutelage of a governess, surrounded by books, and a summer home where his father had built a home theater for family drama productions. Their furniture was designed by Hans Poelzig (now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge University). As a child, he attended the St. Maria Magdalena Gymnasium. After receiving his <i> abiture</i> in 1916, he fought for Germany in World War I where he was wounded in Flanders. After the armistice in 1919, Brieger studied various humanistic disciplines at the universities in Breslau and Munich. He finally settled up on art history, studying under Wilhelm Pinder (q.v.) and, more significantly for him, Paul Frankl (q.v.) and Heinrich Wí_lfflin (q.v.). Between 1922-1927 he was an assistant under August Grisebach (q.v.) at Breslau. He received his Ph.D. in art history in 1924, writing a dissertation under Grisebach on Baroque art. It was partially published in 1926. Between 1927-1928 he researched at the Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rome. He became a <i>privatdozent</i> at Breslau under Grisebach, writing his habilitation on 19th-century history painting in Germany in 1927 (published in Berlin in 1930). Brieger continued as a<i> privatdozent</i> under Dagobert Frey (q.v.) between 1930 and1933. In 1931 he married Barbara Ritter, an historian. In 1933, anticipating the Jewish persecution in Nazi-Germany, Brieger left for Paris. He was officially classified a \"non-Aryan\" by the Nazi government (his family came from Jewish lineage) in 1934, when he finally fled to London. There, he secured work on the <u>Atlas of Medieval Art and Architecture in England</u>, being produced at the Courtauld Institute. The Institute conducted classes largely with temporary appointment faculty, of whom Brieger was one. His years in London turned his attention toward English medieval art, and he remained a medievalist for the rest of his career. In 1936 he moved to Canada seeking permanent employment. There he taught art history at the University of Toronto, rising through the ranks: lecturer and then associate professor, finally professor in 1947. In 1957 he wrote the volume <u>English Art, 1216-1307</u> for the <u>Oxford History of English Art</u>, edited by Thomas Boase (q.v.). He chaired the department between 1965 and 1969. Brieger was a visiting member at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ for the 1964-1965 year. After retirement in 1969 he edited a facsimile edition with Millard Meiss (q.v.) and Charles S. Singleton (1909-1985) on Dante manuscripts. He was a part-time professor at the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies in Toronto until 1973. He contributed to the National Gallery of Canada exhibition, \"Art and the Courts: France and England from 1259 to 1328\" in 1972.Brieger is considered \"a pioneer in Art History as an academic discipline in Canada\" (Eleen).

       "20   Modern art champion in Germany, first director of the Museum fí_r Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg. He married Ida Laura Anna Marie von Froschauer in 1868. Plans for the museum were formulated from 1873 to 1875 thorugh a design of Carl Johann Christian Zimmermann. The Museum was opened in 1877, located on Steintorplatz, officially known as the Staatliches Technikum und Museum fí_r Kunst und Gewerbe (State Center for Technology and Msueum of Fine and Useful Arts). Brinckmann collected a wide range of objects for the museum, from Renaissance painting to Viennese furniture to Japanese prints. He lectured publicly on the collection. Beginning in 1878, one person in Brinckmann's audience was the young <a href=\"/lichtwarka\">Alfred Lichtwark</a>. The two became friends with Brinckmann introducing Lichtwark to the Hamburg industrials Carl Kall, who funded Lichtwark's later studies in art history. The young Otto Kí_mmel, later director of the Berlin Museums, volunteered under Brinckmann in 1902-1904. After Brinckmann's death,<a href=\"/sauerlandtm\"> Max Sauerlandt</a> succeeded him as director in 1919. The Justus Brinckmann Gesellschaft, Hamburg, is named in his honor. His lectures (along with those of Lichtwark) inspired the modernist art historian <a href=\"/schapirer\">Rosa Schapire</a> to become an art historian. Kultermann sites Brinckmann among those <i>Grí_nderzeit</i> museum directors, along with <a href=\"/bodew\">Wilhelm von Bode</a>, Lichtwark, <a href=\"/seidlitzw\">Woldemar von Seidlitz</a>, and <a href=\"/woermannk\">Karl Woermann</a>, as responsible for the formation of art history by virtue of their scholarship and interest in museum training. During the Wilhelmine period, the mercantile Hanseatic city of Hamburg was in the process of establishing a modern identity through new or reinvigorated public institutions and culture.

       "21   Professor of Fine Arts, Institute of Fine Arts, NYU. Buchthal was born to Eugen Buchthal (1878-1954) and Thea Wolff (Buchthal) (1886-1968), wealthy shop owners. The family lived in the \"Villa Buchthal\" on Berlin's west end (after the war, the home of tenor Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, b. 1925). Buchthal attended the Herder-Reform-Gymnasium in Charlottenberg, graduating in 1927. After a semester studying economics, he switched to art history, attending classes at the universities including the Sorbonne, Paris, Heidelberg and Berlin before settling on the so-called new \"Hamburg school\" art historians Fritz Saxl (q.v.), Edgar Wind (q.v.) and Erwin Panofsky (q.v.) and the concomitant Warburg Institute, then directed by Saxl. The accession of power in Germany by the Nazis in 1933 meant that all Jewish university faculty were being summarily discharged. Saxl warned Buchthal that if he could not finish his dissertation by the end of 1933, he would be forced to leave the Warburg without a degree, as the Institute was closing its doors. Panofsky was already living in New York as a visiting professor, but returned briefly to Hamburg that summer for his students oral examinations and dissertations. Buchthal finished his dissertation in the two summer weeks for Panofsky to grant the degree, writing on the Codex Pariinus Graecus 139. He emigrated in 1934 for \"racial reasons\" (he was Jewish) to London with the Warburg Institute staff and library. The Warburg in London became a center for German refugee scholars like Buchthal, including, among others Ernst Gombrich (q.v.) and Wind. In 1935 he studied Arabic at the School of Oriental and African Studies before receiving a fellowship from 1936 to 1937 at the University of Beirut. He was the 1938 Lord Plumer Fellow at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. That same year he also re-edited and published his dissertation, <u>The Illustrations of the Paris Psalter: a Study in Middle Byzantine Painting</u> (1938). In 1939 her married Amalia \"Maltschi\" Serkin (1904-1996), sister of the pianist Rudolf Serkin (1903-1991). The Warburg Institute was evacuated to Denham, England, at the outbreak of World War II. Buchthal acted as librarian for the Institute during 1941-43, becoming a Lecturer a the University of London 1944-45 (which subsumed the Institute). He was a visiting fellow at Dumbarton Oaks 1950-51 and again in 1965. In 1957 he published perhaps his most influential book, <u> Miniature Painting in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem</u>. Buchthal was the first to organize the illuminated manuscripts produced in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, from the twelfth-century Melisende Psalter to the later manuscripts written in Acre, into a cohesive body for discussion. His book remains a detailed introduction to the manuscripts and a comprehensive study of Crusader miniature painting. In 1959-60 Buchtal was appointed a temporary member at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ. The years 1960-65 Buchthal was an endowed chair at the Warburg Institute with the year 1963 as a visiting professor at Columbia University, New York. Between 1965-75 he was the first Ailsa Mellon Bruce Chair in Fine Arts at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1970 and 1971. The1970s were a period of great publishing activity for Buchthal. His books include works on both French and Italian manuscripts of the legend of the fall of Troy, <u>Historia Troiana</u> (1971), and later Byzantine painting, <u>Patronage in Thirteenth-century Constantinople</u>, with Hans Belting (q.v.), (1978). From 1975 onward he was a professor emeritus at New York University. Buchthal's students at the Warburg included Michael Kauffmann (q.v.), who would later become its director. His Institute of Fine Arts students included Harvey Stahl (q.v.). Buchthal died of a heart ailment at age 87; his wife, Amalia, died less than a week later. Buchthal's area was Byzantine and western medieval art. His 1957 <u> Miniature Painting in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem</u> (1957) was praised for weaving paleographic and liturgical analysis with meticulous visual skill. Buchthal was particularly interested in the transfers of traditions and culture between the medieval east and west. He is credited for opening the area of Crusader culture as an area for art historical study. Thomas F. Mathews (q.v.), a former student, described Buchthal's writings as laying \"the foundation for all subsequent work on the art of the Crusaders.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "23   Peter Paul Rubens scholar. Burchard's father was an apothecary in Mainz, Georg Burchard. Burchard himself attended the Grossherzogliches Gymnasium in Karlsruhe, graduating in 1904. He studied at the universities of Munich, Heidelberg and Halle-Wittenberg. During this time he volunteered at the print room in Dresden and Berlin where he earned the praise of director <a href=\"/bodew\">Wilhem von Bode</a>. Burchard served in the German army in World War I in field artillery. His 1917 dissertation was written at Halle under <a href=\"/goldschmidta\">Adolph Goldschmidt</a> on Rembrandt etchings. He married Lily Stange in 1919. In the 1920s he was editor of the <u> Allgemeines K</u><u>í_nstler-Lexikon</u> founded by <a href=\"/thiemeu\">Ulrich Thieme</a> and <a href=\"/beckerf\">Felix Becker</a>, (\"Thieme-Becker\") in Leipzig. He was also on the staff of the periodical <u>Kunstchronik</u>. Burchard moved to Berlin as the editor of <u>Zeitschrift f</u><u>í_r bildenden Kunst</u>, 1921-22. In 1921, too, he completed the volume on Rubens in the <u>Klassiker der Kunst</u> series left undone by the premature death of <a href=\"/oldenbourgr\">Rudolf Oldenbourg</a>. It was at this time that he envisioned a new <i>catalogue raisonn</i><i>í©</i> of Rubens' work, the task of which would be his life's assignment. A brief article on Cornelis van Dalem in the <u>Jahrbuch des Preussischen Kunstsammlung</u> in 1924 establish the importance of that little-known master. One of his assistants during this time was the young art historian and later important modernist <a href=\"/wescherh\">Hertha Wescher</a>. The ascension to power of the Nazi's in 1933 meant trouble for Burchard, who, though nominally protestant, had a Jewish mother. He emigrated to London in 1935, settling outside the city with his then large archive of Rubens material. Burchard took in other emingres to work on his project, including <a href=\"/grossmannf\">Fritz Grossmann</a>. In 1939 Burchard published a prospectus of his upcoming catalog, <u>The Work of Peter Paul Rubens</u>, then projected for six volumes. The outbreak of World War II halted his publishing plans, however. In England, Burchard was intern briefly in 1940. After the war, many Rubens paintings appeared on the market and others, still, required cleaning and re-examination after their hiding in bomb shelters. Thus the critical catalog project was once again delayed. In 1955 Burchard conducted seminar on Rubens for the annual summer \"Belgian Art Seminar\" which had been established in 1951 by Herman Liebaers, Director of the Royal Library of Belgium. The following year Burchard expanded this to a Rubenshius exhibition of Rubens drawings, celebrating Burchard's 75th birthday. The exhibition catalog, co-written with <a href=\"/hulstr\">Roger d'Hulst</a><a href=\"/dhulstr\"></a>, was expanded in 1963 and remains one of the most important monographs on the topic. Burchard frequented the major auction houses and provided many written opinions to them. At Burchard's death, his papers were acquired by the Kunsthistorische Musea by <a href=\"/baudouinf\">Frans Baudouin</a> principally to edit the core of the Rubenianum, a documentation center for the study of Rubens and 16th- and 17th-century Flemish art. It is housed in the Kolveniersstraat in Antwerp. One stipulation of the donation was that a <i>catalogue raison</i><i>í©</i> on Rubens should be published based on Burchard's materials. The city of Antwerp made an agreement with Burchard's heirs and the Nationaal Centrum voor de Plastische Kunsten van de 16de en de 17de Eeuw (today the Centrum voor de Vlaamse kunst van de 16de en 17de eeuw), chaired by d'Hulst, to edit and produce the set, known as the <u>Corpus Rubenianum Ludwig Burchard</u>. Burchard was criticized during his lifetime and after for having withheld much of the material he collected or controlled at the Rubenshuis from other scholars. His own reasons for never publishing his work on Rubens were his dissatisfaction with the ever-imperfect state of Rubens information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "27   Collaborator of Offner's <u>Critical and Historical Corpus of Florentine Painting</u>. Cohn studied in Berlin between 1923-26 under Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.) and Freiburg, 1926-29 under Hans Jantzen (q.v.), for whom he wrote his dissertation in 1929. His topic was on Han Holbein the Younger. Between 1931 and 1933 Cohn worked as a volunteer in the prints and drawings and library sections at the Staatlichen Museen in Berlin. When the Nazis came to power, Cohn, a protestant of Jewish lineage, was dismissed from his position. He worked for the Heitz publishing firm in Strassburg on their book series on prints (Einblattdrucke) from specific publishers and libraries until 1935 when he emigrated to Italy. There, New York University professor Richard Offner (q.v.) hired him as an assistant, in addition to another German, Klara Steinweg (q.v.), to work on his corpus of Florentine painting, the <u>Critical and Historical Corpus of Florentine Painting</u>. When World War II erupted in Europe, Cohn and Offner left for the United States and Steinweg back to Germany. Cohn spent the war years back in Italy, in Assisi, gathering material on the influence of the \"commune\" on 13th-century cultural life. After the war, Cohn returned to Florence where he worked as a translator and in the archives of the Uffizi. He was working on a documentary volume of Florentine painting, supported by a research grant from Germany, when he died at age 55.

       "28   Scholar of Italian painting. Her father was a lawyer and her mother a painter and concert pianist. After receiving the highest honors of her Abiturum from the Gymnasium under which she studied, she won a scholarship which enabled her to spend a year at Wells College, Aurora, NY. She returned to Germany only to find Nazi control of her selected university, Munich, too much to for a Jew such as herself to tolerate. She moved to Perugia in 1935 only to find the same political hatred there. She stayed with friends at the University in Cardiff, Wales, before securing a scholarship via the Institute for International Education to attend Bryn Mawr in 1938. She received US citizenship the same year. Without an undergraduate degree, Achenbach was permitted to begin graduate work, achieving an M.A. in 1940. In 1945 Charles Rufus Morey (q.v.) offered Achenbach a position with the Index of Christian Art at Princeton. She worked there while writing her dissertation at the Institute of Fine Art at New York University under Richard Offner (q.v.). An photograph often used in art historiographic texts of the post-war faculty of the Institute is a picture of her Ph.D. defense. Achenbach married a Princeton physicist, Thomas Coor in 1946. She received her Ph.D. in 1948 on a topic of Coppo di Marcovaldo. The years 1948-50 were spent with her husband in London where she was informally attached to the Warburg Institute. Returning to Princeton, the Coors settled permanently with Gertrude again working at the Index of Christian Art and teaching courses at Rutgers University in 1958 and 1959. She accepted a research assistant position under Millard Meiss (q.v.) at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton in 1959. In 1961 her book on Neroccio de' Landi appeared. As a woman in the 1950s married to a university professor, she was expected to keep house and run the other domestic activities in addition to whatever scholarship she wanted to pursue. Coor purportedly worked sixteen hours every day on her research in addition to her wife duties. Coor was a consultant for the Kress Collection at the Cleveland Museum of Art. She was at work on a book on the evolution of the Sienese altarpiece when she contracted a terminal illness and died at 47.

       "134  Early historian of photography; scholar of graphics in general. Schwarz graduated from the Akademisches Gymnasium in Vienna with an Abitur in 1913. He entered the university in Vienna studying art history, archaeology and philosophy. At the outbreak of World War I, Schwarz served in the Austrian miliary, 1914, assigned to the field artillery. He resumed his studies in 1919, writing a disseration on the beginning of lithography in Vienna, under the \"Vienna School\" scholar <a href=\"/dvorakm\">Max Dvo»íçk</a>, though his degree came after Dvo»íçk's death in 1921. He worked as a volunteer at the Albertina Musum print collection, 1921-1923. Still unsalaried, he was promoted to a scholar research assistant from 1923 to 1927. That yeat, 1927 he accepted a position as curator at the Austrian Gallery, \"Baroque Museum\" (Belvedere) in the 19th-century gallery under F. M. Haberditzl. Schwarz was responsible for many exhibitions on 19th-century art at the museum, which opened in 1929, foreign exhibitions, as well as the 1934 Venice Biennale. Though Schwarz' field of study was graphics in general, his early interest in photography as an art medium made him a pioneer in the field. He was the first to write (in 1931) on the photographer David Octavius Hill. The annexation of Austria by the Nazis in 1938 meant that Schwarz, a Roman Catholic of Jewish decent, could no longer work in national museums. Schwarz sold part of his personal library to move to Sweden the same year. He immigrated to the United States in 1940 working as a research assistant at the Albright Knox Museum in Buffalo, NY. Schwarz received financial living assistance from <a href=\"/warburge\">Edward M. \"Eddie\" Warburg</a>, an arts benefactor, amateur art historians and nephew of art historian <a href=\"/warburga\">Aby Warburg</a>. In 1943 he was appointed curator for painting, drawing and prints at the Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design. He married in 1948, remaining at RISD until 1953. After two years as a visiting professor, 1954-1956, at Wesleyan University, Middletown, CT, he taught as professor there 1956-1962 and as the curator of the Davidson Art Center Collection (the latter through 1972). Schwarz lectured at visiting professor at Columbia University between 1966 and 1968 as a replacement for <a href=\"/heldj\">Julius Held</a>. He retired emeritus in 1972. \"Schwarz was a pioneer of the study of photography's historical evolution and development and its relationship with the traditional pictorial arts. He proposed that photography benefited from the 'inner-preparedness' it had been given by the fact that the 'fixed viewpoint had become the <em>alpha</em> and <em>omega</em> of the aesthetic credo.\" (Hamber). Beaumont Newhall characterized Schwarz's book on Hill as one where the author recognized and treated Hill as an artist who \"happened to use a camera.\" (Wendland).

       "136  Scholar of medieval and renaissance architectural and art history; professor at the University of Chicago 1945-1957. Simson was the son of Ernst Eduard von Simson, and undersecretary of state in the German foreign office, and Martha Enole (von Simson), a descendent of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786). His great grandfather had originally been Jewish but converted to Roman Catholicism. Simson himself grew up in the cultured home of his grandfather, the chemist Franz Oppenheim (1852-1929) in the \"Villa Oppenheim.\" Their neighbor was the director of the Hamburg Kunsthalle <a href=\"/lichtwarka\">Alfred Lichtwark</a>, who inhabited the villa formerly owned by Max Liebermann. The young Simson grew up among the masterworks of German Impressionism. His family was highly distinguished in German politics and statecraft, his father served as a state administrator. Simson attended the Arndtgymnasium in Berlin Dahlem Dorf. After graduation (age 17) he was sent to England to learn English. After returning, he entered the university in Freiburg studying art history under under <a href=\"/jantzenh\">Hans Jantzen</a>, <a href=\"/friedlanderw\">Walter Friedlí_nder</a>, and <a href=\"/bauchk\">Kurt Bauch</a>. He studied briefly in Berlin before focusing moving to Munich in 1932 to study under <a href=\"/pinderw\">Wilhelm Pinder</a>. Most of Simson's work, however was under <a href=\"/eversh\">Hans Eberhard Evers</a>. Simson completed a dissertation on Rubens, and published as <u>Zur Genealogie der weltlichen Apotheose im Barock, besonders der Medicigalerie des Peter Paul Rubens</u>, in 1936. He married the princess Aloysia (Louise) Alexandra von Schí_nburg Hartenstein (1906-1976) the same year. Simson worked initially at the Courtauld Institute Library in 1936 and as an editor for the periodical <u>Hochland</u> in Munich. He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1937. With Germany's seizure of Czech lands, the so-called Czech Crisis, Simson was drafted into the German army. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Simson used his military <i>Wehrpass</i> (military pass) to visit American museums on the excuse of his being an art historian; he remained in the U.S. with his wife and children following. He taught briefly at Marymount College in Tarrytown, New York (1939-43) (an offer to teach at Johns Hopkins came too late) and St. Mary's College in Notre Dame, Indiana. In 1945 University of Chicago president Robert Maynard Hutchins (1899-1977) offered Simson a job in the University's Committee on Social Thought and only secondarily in the Department of Art. He rose to full professor in 1951. During this period he produced two major books characteristic of his methodology. The first, <u>The Sacred Fortress</u> (he despised the title; it was suggested by his editor) appeared in 1948. He was also a guest resident at the University of Frankfurt in the years immediately after the war. Simson's <u>The Gothic Cathedral</u> appeared in 1956 and with it a rave review in the <u>Times Literary Supplement</u>, but a caustic review by <a href=\"/crosbys\">Sumner Crosby</a> in the <u>Art Bulletin</u>. The heated exchange broke a long-standing friendship between the two. Simson returned to Germany in 1957, taking a position first at the university Frankfurt, and then as the first German member of UNESCO. In 1964 he became Director of the Kunsthistorisches Institut of the Freie Universití_t in Berlin (succeeding literary historian Hans Kaufmann, 1926-2000) and professor of modern art. At the Freie Universití_t he was instrumental in sponsoring several conferences on Dutch art, such as the 1970 one on Rembrandt and the 1975 one on Brueghel. In 1972 he edited and wrote the revision to the prestigious <u>Propylí_en Kunstgeschichte</u> volume on the middle ages, <u>Das Mittelalter II: das Hohe Mittelalter</u>, along with <a href=\"/fillitzh\">Hermann Fillitz</a> and others. After the death of his first wife in 1976, he married another woman of noble lineage, Marie-Anne zu Salm-Reifferscheidt-Krautheim und Dyck (b. 1933) in 1978. He remained at the Freie Universití_t until 1979. In 1986 his book, <u>Der Blick nach Innen</u>, the result of lectures he presented at Harvard on nineteenth-century German art, Simson put forth the concept of \"Innerlichkeit\" as characteristic in the work of four German painters, Caspar David Friedrich, Carl Spitzweg, Wilhelm Leibl and Ludwig Richter. The posthumous <u>Peter Paul Rubens (1577 1640) Humanist, Maler, Diplomat</u> (1996) brought together Simson's work on the artist with whom he had been preoccupied, though little published, for much of his career. Simson's methodology was in large part to lay an intellectual <em>Geistesgeschichte</em> framework over his studies of medieval architecture. His book <u>The Sacred Fortress</u> deals with the mosaics of Ravenna in terms of the liturgy which would have been used at the time. Because of the war, Simson never had a chance to examine the mosaics during the time he wrote the book. His <u>Gothic Cathedral</u> put him in the middle of a wider, 20th-century dialogue on Gothic architecture with <a href=\"/sedlmayrh\">Hans Sedlmayr</a>, <a href=\"/panofskye\">Erwin Panofsky</a> and Crosby. He and Sedlmayr wrote of the Gothic church as a mystical <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em>, a totality of all artistic media, whose meaning had to be derived from experiencing the building as a whole, as opposed to scholars who sought to dissect a building to interpret its iconographic parts (Crossley). Simson's erudite study of Abbot Suger's choir in the <u>Gothic Cathedral</u> postulated the formation of the Gothic as a combination of \"Pseudo-Dionysian light metaphysics\" and the harmonic ratios of musical cosmology. This interpretation was challenged by <a href=\"/gosebruchm\">Martin Gosebruch</a> and denied by <a href=\"/kidsonp\">Peter Kidson</a> as over-intellectualizing. Simson's published dissertation on the secular apotheosis in Baroque art found praise early from Panofsky. Simson conceived his Propylí_en series <u>Das Mittelalter II: das Hohe Mittelalter</u> as an extension of his <u>Gothic Cathedral</u>, but greatly internationalized, with Polish scholars writing the sections on the art in Poland formerly under German rule. He was known as an engaging lecturer and warm to his many students.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "137  Professor at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 1940-62. Sommer's father was a general in the German army during World War I to which the younger Sommer also served. Sommer received his doctorate at the University in Freiburg in 1919. In 1937 Sommer was summoned to Nazi Party headquarters and told to divorce his wife who, while religiously Lutheran, was suspected of having \"Jewish blood.\" Sommer understood the threat and accepted a visiting lectureship in Sweden in order to surreptitiously leave Germany altogether. In 1938 Sommer immigrated to the United States where he accepted a position to teach art history at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill by then department director Russell Smith. He rose quickly to associate professor in 1940 and full professor in 1947. He was known for lecturing with his cocker spaniel at his side. In 1951, Sommer was one of a five-member committee to establish the first state-funded art museum in the nation, which later became the North Carolina Museum of Art. He was killed in an auto accident at 69.

       "138  Scholar of the Dutch baroque, especially graphics and Ruysdael; Oberlin University professor1940-63. Stechow's father, Waldemar Stechow, was an attorney and his mother, Bertha Deutschmann, a concert singer. As a young man, Stechow was educated at the Gymnasium in Gí_ttingen and, after graduating in 1913, volunteered for the German Army at the outbreak of World War I the following year. In 1915 he was taken prisoner of war by the Russians and spent the next two years in a Siberian camp. He returned to Gí_ttingen where he wrote his dissertation at Georgia Augusta University under <a href=\"/vitzthumg\">Count Georg Vizthum</a> on the subject of Dí_rer's Apocalypse. He served as an assistant keeper of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin, under <a href=\"/bodew\">Wihlem von Bode</a> 1921-1922, before he returning to Gí_ttingen (1923-1935). There he taught courses as a <em>privatdozent</em> with <a href=\"/pevsnern\">Nikolaus Pevsner</a>. There, too, he collaborated as part of the group of German scholars <a href=\"/hofstededegrootc\">Hofstede de Groot</a> assembled for his new volumes of the <em>catalogue raisonní©</em> of Dutch Painting (1923, 1926). Stechow wrote his <em>Habilitationsschrift</em> in 1926 on Dutch mannerism, also under Vizthum. A talented violinist and keyboardist, Stechow performed and organized musical concerts in Gí_ttingen between 1923-1936. During the same time, he contributed many entries for the 37-volume \"Thieme-Becker\" <u>Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden Kí_nstler</u> on Dutch artists. He was appointed Extraordinarius professor at Gí_ttingen in 1931. A protestant of Jewish decent, he lost his academic position at the hands of the Nazi government in 1936. Vizthum sheltered him long enough for Stechow to publish his Salomon Ruysdael book and catalog in 1938. Stechow emigrated to the United States in the same year, were art historian <a href=\"/hageno\">Oskar Hagen</a>, a friend from Gí_ttingen days, secured him a position as Assistant Professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where Hagen also taught. Stechow left Madison for Oberlin College in 1940, a position he held until his emeritus designation in 1963. Stechow was a renowned teacher who made the deliberate choice to devote his energies to pedagogy rather than book publication. Although his articles number over 200, he produced comparatively few monographs. His best known work, <u>Dutch Landscape Painting of the Seventeenth Century</u> (1966) was written after his retirement. In 1964 he began as advisory curator at the Cleveland Museum of Art, where he was instrumental in acquiring outstanding Dutch paintings. Stechow lectured and taught extensively during his life. It was while at Princeton teaching a class in retirement, that he died. A second edition of the Ruysdael catalog appeared after his death. Stechow's training was strong in connoisseurship, to which he added the study of iconography. Although excellent in what he did, his methodology attracted criticism. <a href=\"/steinbergl\">Leo Steinberg</a> criticized Stechow in a book review which Stechow took personally, causing a noted enmity between the two the remainder of their careers. Stechow is most closely associated with authenticity of paintings using connoisseurship (Rysdael). His other major monograph, <u>Dutch Landscape Painting</u>, shows him avoiding the common practice of historic periodization in favor of thematic groupings. The chair of Oberlin during the 1950s, <a href=\"/parkhurstc\">Charles Parkhurst</a>, recalled Stechow's affinities for puns and great wit; Stechow, he said, referred to the introductory course in art history as \"From mud to Klee.\" His students included <a href=\"/gersonh\">Horst Gerson</a>, <a href=\"/schonew\">Wolfgang Schí_ne</a>, <a href=\"/gronauh\">Hans Gronau</a>, Reinhold Behrens and Adolf Isermeyer. Writing on Stechow's behalf in 1934 for immigration to the United States, <a href=\"/panofskye\">Erwin Panofsky</a> praised him as, \"the most distinguished younger art historians of Germany..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "141  Kress Foundation art historian; Italian renaissance specialist. Suida was born to Albert Suida and Betha von Heim, his mother a descendant of Richard Wagner. His uncle was the art historian <a href=\"/thodeh\">Henry Thode</a>. After attending a Gymnasium in Vienna, he studied art history in Vienna under <a href=\"/riegla\">Alois Riegl</a> and <a href=\"/wickhofff\">Franz Wickhoff</a>, in Leipzig and finally Heidelberg under Thode with whom he wrote his dissertation in 1899. It was published the following year. Between 1902-04 he was an assistant at the Deutsches Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence, the model for Italian research institutes, where he researched the book for his habilitation. He qualified with a 1905 monograph on Florentine painting. He taught as a <i>Privatdozent</i> in Vienna and for the academic year 1909-10 at the Technische Hochschule in Graz, Austria. Beginning in 1911 was appointed a professor of art history at the university in Graz, and managed the picture gallery (Bildergalerie) of the Landesmuseum Joanneum in Graz. During World War I he fought as a captain. Between 1934-38 he was on leave teaching at various schools in Austria and Italy, but with the annexation of Austria by the Nazis in 1939, he emigrated first to England and then to the United States. In 1947 he found a position as Head of the department of art-historical research at the Kress Foundation, advising on art purchases for Samuel Kress and later helping to disperse the collection to museums across the United States. His daughter Bertina Suida (d. 1992) studied art history at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts where she met fellow art history student Robert Manning. They married and the elder Suida gave his son-in-law a position as curator for the Kress collection. Bertina was a curator at the Chrysler Collection. William and his children amassed large personal collections of Baroque art. Suida was an expert in Lombard art and only slightly less Venetian. At his death in 1959, his collection passed to his children. The combined art collection was donated to the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas, Austin, in1999, as the Suida-Manning Collection.

       "142  Medievalist and modernist; Director of Frankfurt art museums and later a Museum of Fine Art, Boston acquisitions curator, 1939-1957. Swarzenski's father was Adolf Hanns Swarzenski, a prosperous Dresden merchant originally of Jewish origin, and his mother, Auguste Beck (Swarzenski). In 1896 graduated with a degree in law from Heidelberg. He married Ella Perec-Wilcynska, [name sometimes appearing as Pertz-Wilcynska] in 1899, turning his attention to art history. Swarzenski studied art under the great medievalist Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.) in Berlin and in Heidelberg under Henry Thode (q.v.), gaining his second degree in 1901. His dissertation was on the Regensburg school of manuscript illumination of the tenth and eleventh centuries. He initially worked as an assistant at the research assistant at the Berlin Museums where he likely habilitated in 1903, when he was designation a privatdozent. After a year as an assistant at the Kunsthistorischen Institut in Florence, he returned to Berlin as an assistant for the Kunstgewerbemuseum (\"useful arts\" museum). In 1906 he was appointed director of the Stí_delsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt, a privately endowed and operated art museum, which Thode had at one time directed. Seeing the need to acquire more art than the Stí_delsches could afford, Swarzenski convinced the city of Frankfurt to found its own, publicly funded art museum, the Stí_dtische Galerie, (municipal gallery) to buy works, under Swarzenski's direction, to complement the Stí_delsches holdings. The Stí_dtische collection grew to include works by the Impressionists (Monet) and Post-Impressionists (Cí©zanne and van Gogh) and later by Picasso, Munch, Ensor and Die Brí_cke artists and others of German Expressionism, some of whom taught at the Kunstinstitut. He hired the fledgling art historian Fritz Wichert (q.v.) to assist him. In 1909 Swarzenski opened a combined museum, though still distinct in terms of collections, which he jointly directed with the Liebieghaus sculpture museum. He married a second time in 1916, to Marie Mí_ssinger. The following year, he contributed essays on modern art for the important survey, <u>Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft</u>. Together with his assistant, the art historian Alfred Wolters (q.v.), he founded the <u>Stí_del Jahrbuch</u> beginning in 1921 (which they co-edited through 1936). About this time, he began a liaison with Calola Netter, whom he installed in the museum as his intern. A double portrait of his wife and mistress was painted by Max Beckmann in 1923. Swarzenski was gifted museum innovator. He organized period rooms for decorative arts in his museums. Between 1925-1931 he held musical concerts in the rooms, one of the first directors to do so. His knowledge of the art market brought many masterworks to his museums. He was also of sufficient means that he could afford to donate pictures to the museum personally; the famous van Gogh portrait of Dr. Gachet was one of these. Swarzenski wrote columns in the local newspaper, the <u>Frankfurter Zeitung</u>, communicating his interests and the museums' needs to the German and greater European public. In 1928 Swarzenski was appointed Director-General of all Frankfurt museums. He used his new position to purchase a significant part of the large Sigmaringen collection. The museum's Kunstgewerbemuseum, also rose to prominence under Swarzenski's direction. As a director somewhat ahead of his time, he mounted an early \"blockbuster\" show, a display of goldsmithing work, known as the Welfenschatz, which attracted huge crowds from the region. The rise of the Nazis to power in 1933 put Swarzenski into direct conflict with their ideas of art. Forced to remove many works of modernist art from the museums walls because of their \"degenerate\" designation by the Nazis--and distrusted for his Jewish background--Swarzenski ultimately resigned in 1938 and fled to United States. Many of the modernist works he acquired, including his personal donation of the Dr. Gachet, were deaccessioned and sold. In the United States, he lectured at Institute for Advance Studies, Princeton, NJ, for the 1938-1939 year before Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Director G. H. Edgell (q.v.) offered him a position to build the medieval area of the collection. His 1940 Boston exhibition, \"Arts of the Middle Ages: 1000-1400,\" marked Boston as a center of interest in the middle ages. He retired in 1956 and was succeeded by his son, Hanns Swarzenski (q.v.) who also distinguished himself at Boston as an art historian.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "143  Medievalist; Curator of Decorative Arts and Sculpture at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,1956-1973. Swarzenski grew up in Frankfurt, Germany, where his father, Georg Swarzenski (q.v.) was the director of the Stí_delsches Kunstinstitut (museum) and the Liebieghaus sculpture museum. His mother was Ella Perec-Wilcynska, [name sometimes appearing as Pertz-Wilcynska]. As a young man he met the German Expressionist artist Max Beckmann who taught at the Stí_delsches school. He studied art history at Freiburg under Walter Friedlaender (q.v.), in Berlin, under Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.), under whom his father had also studied, and from whom he likely honed his connoisseurship skills. While pursuing his dissertation, he participated in the <em>Jahrtausundaustellung</em> (millenial celebration) in Dí_sseldorf in 1925 under Fritz Witte (q.v.). The exhibition gave him early and unusual experience with manuscripts and medieval art. He received his Ph.D. from the University in Bonn in 1927 with a dissertation on medieval German book illumination under Paul Clemen (q.v.). He became a fellow of the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence. He was awarded a travel grant to study as a Fellow at the Fogg Museum, Harvard University in 1928. He returned to Berlin and worked at the state art museums there as a stagiaire. In Berlin, Swarzenski kept abreast of all the arts, becoming acquainted with the Bauhaus and Brí_cke masters Mies van der Rohe, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Gerhard Marcks and Andreas Feininger. In 1936 he published his major work, <u>Die lateinischen illuminierten Handschriften des XIII. Jahrhunderts</u>. He used the modest honorarium he was paid for the book to buy a Beckmann painting. He left Nazi-controlled Germany in 1938--although a Protestant Christian he was from a Jewish background--accepting an offer to assist Erwin Panofsky (q.v.) at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. His father resigned and followed a short while later. At the Institute, Swarzenski published his book on the Berthold Missal. He became acting curator of sculpture at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC in 1943 (many museum personnel were in the war). Upon their return in 1946 he lost his position. In 1948 he was offered a position as a Research fellow in Medieval art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where his father also held that status. In 1948 year he wrote a forward to a catalog on his friend, Beckmann, in the first American retrospective of his art in St. Louis, MO. Between 1950-1956 he periodically lectured at the Warburg Institute in London. He married Brigitte Horney, an actress, in 1953. The same year he published his important <u>Monuments of Romanesque Art</u>, still a handbook for the period. He succeeded his father as Curator of Decorative Arts and Sculpture in the Museum in 1956, appointed by director Perry Rathbone (q.v.), whom he had known since Rathbone's days in St. Louis. Among Swarzenski's acquisitions during the Boston years were two works rejected as forgeries by other museums, the Lombard Virgin and Child, acquired in 1959, and an Ile-de-France Virgin and Child, both ca. 1200. In the early 1960s, Swarzenski identified a large 12th-century ivory cross offered to the Museum by a private seller. When he and Rathbone determined the Museum could not afford the treasure, it was referred to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Thomas Hoving (q.v.) who ultimately acquired it as the (now famous) Cloister's Cross. Hoving neglected to mention in his memoirs Swarzenski's contribution. As a curator for all European sculpture, Swarzenski also purchased works by Giacometti, Calder, Brancusi and Henry Moore for the Museum. A 1972 festschrift contained artwork commissioned by both Beckmann and Calder. In 1973 he retired to a home in Wilzhofen, Oberbayern, Germany, where he died in 1985. Swarzenski's <u>Monuments of Romanesque Art</u> remains a characteristic work. It lacks extensive comment on the objects in favor of allowing the works to speak for themselves. Walter Cahn (q.v.) speculated that Swarzensky was equally uncomfortably with public oratory. A trained connoisseur in the postivistic vein of Goldschmidt, Swarzenski remained a true art historian rather than like so many German medievalists, an iconographer. His personal art collection, which, in addition to Beckmann, extended to Paul Klee and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, was made possible by art dealers who sold him these works modestly in exchange for Museum patronage of medieval works (Rathbone).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "144  Historian of Renaissance and Baroque art; wife of art historian Hans Tietze (q.v.). Conrat was the daughter of Hugo Conrat, a wealthy Viennese businessman with an enormous passion for music. Brahms was a dinner guest during Conrat's childhood and versions of her father's poetry Brahms set to music (<u>Zigeunerlieder</u>, opus 103). She attended the Institut Hanausek until age twelve and then the new Mí_dchenschule gymnasium, graduating in 1901. She attended the University of Vienna between 1902-1905 where she met a young art history graduate student, <a href=\"/tietzeh\">Hans Tietze</a>, both students of the first \"Vienna school\" art historian <a href=\"/wickhofff\">Franz Wickhoff</a>. She wrote and published her dissertation under Wickhoff in 1905 on Austrian baroque sculptor Georg Raphael Donner (1693-1741), only the second woman to be graduated in art history during Wickhoff's tenure. Conrat married Tietze in December of 1905, the same year as her first published article. As Europe lacked any significant teaching positions for women then, Tietze-Conrat assisted her husband in his first position as an investigator for the commission on preservation of Austrian monuments (Zentralkommision fí_r Denkmalpflege). The Tietzes had four children between 1908 and 1918. Her husband served in the Austrian army from 1914, his duties still connected with the preservation of monuments, only now in north Italy. The Tietzes were first and foremost a research team. The Tietzes left the raising of thier children to a trusted nanny (who lived with the family until age 90). Both from well-to-do families, the art historian husband/wife team saw as part of their mission the support of contemporary art in Vienna as well as its historical research. Oskar Kokoschka was commissioned to paint a portrait of the two in 1909 (today, Museum of Modern Art, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Fund, 651.39). Together they helped organize the Vienna Society for the Advancement of Contemporary Art (Gesellschaft zur Fí_rderung der modernen Kunst in Wien) in 1920. As art historians, the Tietzes worked closely together, their desks pushed facing each other in order to facilitate discussion. Each, however, continued to publish separately as well as together. Hans Tietze made guest lectures to the United States in 1932 and 1935, Erica joining him on the second journey. The discovery of a large amount of material in the Uffizi on Venetian drawings by Erica Tietze-Conrat gave her the idea to publish a catalog of drawings from the Republic. From 1935 onward they traveled with that thought in mind. When the <i>Anschluss</i> came in 1938, Tietze-Conrat was in Italy, unaware of the situation. Her husband escaped Austria (both were from Jewish-extraction families) and met her in Italy. After word that their grown children were safe, the couple continued their research, visiting museums in the Netherlands and Paris. In 1939 they emigrated to the United States, leaving their housekeeper to watch over their Austrian home throughout the war. Hans Tietze taught for a single year as a Carnegie Professor at the Toledo Museum of Art before the couple moved to New York. During these financially difficult times, they sold their Kokoschka and joined the large cultural expatriate community there. They became American citizens in 1944. Hans never found an academic appointment in America, his only income coming from occasional assignments from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art, Washington. When Columbia University offered him a course on Venetian art in the spring semester of 1954, Tietze, who was dying of cancer, was too ill to finish the class. Erica completed the lectures and was subsequently asked to lecture at Columbia again in 1955 and 1956. This was her only academic position as well. Her strong convictions to art remained. As a young Ph.D. candidate from Princeton, <a href=\"/hovingt\">Thomas Hoving</a> recalled Tietze Conrat's intimidating shouts of \"You--Are--Wrong!\" at graduate student symposia at the Frick Collection (McPhee). In 1955 she published a monograph on Mantegna and two years later, <u>Dwarfs and Jesters in Art</u>. In 1970 a room in the í_sterreichisches Barockmuseum, Lower Belvedere, was named in her honor for having revived the study of neglected Austrian masters such as Donner. Both Tietze-Conrat and her husband are noted for their compilation of fastidious catalogs. The three-volume critical catalog of Albrecht Dí_rer (1928-38) contains all the categories of a modern evaluative <em>catalogue raisonní©</em>. Many of the articles both published were the result of their research in catalog compilation. Their second combined achievement, a critical catalog of Venetian drawings (1944), required that they examine a relatively untouched area of Italian works on paper. Unlike Roman or Florentine, Venetian drawings were relatively unstudied. Savvy enough to understand that students often copied master drawings, they used carefully developed standards to authenticate autograph pieces. Some of their findings and attributions have not borne the test of time, particularly their assertion that the \"Sketchbooks of Jacopo Bellini\" represent many artists work over a range of years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "145  \"Vienna School\"-trained historian of Venetian art; author of a major \"principles of art history\" monograph and developer of Baroque Museum, Vienna. Tietze was the son of a Czech lawyer, Siegfried Tietze (d. 1920), and Auguste Pohl. The family name had originally been Taussig. He attended the Gymnasium Altstadt in Prague. His father converted the family from Judaism to protestant Christianity in 1893 moving the family to Vienna. Tietze graduated from the Schottengymnasium there in 1898. Anxious to be seen as fully Austrian, he volunteered for a year's service in the Austrian army 1899-1900. Following discharge he entered the university in Vienna studying archaeology and history and art history between 1900-1903. Vienna's art history program was in the midst of solidifying its famous \"Vienna School\" methodology and Tietze studied with the masters including <a href=\"/riegla\">Alois Riegl</a>, <a href=\"/schlosserj\">Julius von Schlosser</a> and <a href=\"/wickhofff\">Franz Wickhoff</a>. He wrote his dissertation under Wickhoff on the topic of medieval typological representation, awarded his degree in 1903. His article on Francesco de Hollanda was termed by Schlosser \"an exemplary piece of research\" (Held). In 1905 he married fellow Vienna art-history student <a href=\"/tietzee\">Erika Conrat</a> who hailed from a prominent and cultural Viennese family. Tietze wrote his <em>habilitation</em> (also under Wickhoff) on the topic of Anibale Caracci's frescos at the Palazzo Farnese, accepted in 1905. Study of baroque artists was still rare in academic art history, the period generally considered degenerate. Tietze worked as Wickhoff's assistant holding an <i>ad personam</i> chair in the Erstes Kunsthistorisches Institut of <a href=\"/strzygowski\">Josef Strzygowski</a>. The Tietzes raised their four children largely with a governness so as to be able to devote their energies to art. He became an assisant at the Commission for Monument Preseveration (Zentralkommission fí_r Denkmalplege), rising to secretary of the Commision in 1909. Headng a relatively small staff, he oversaw an inventory of monuments ultimately comprising thirteen volumes, <u>í_sterreichische Kunsttopographie</u>. In 1909, too, he was accepted as a <em>Privatdozent</em> at the University. Tietze and his wife enthusiastically supported modern art, commissioning the twenty-three-year-old expressionist paingter Oskar Kokoschka to paint their marriage portrait in 1909. When World War I broke out, he mobilized into the army again intially seeing action but later as an officer assigned to art protection in Italy (1914-1918). At the war's conclusion--disastrous for Austria--he, as a negotiator for war reparations of Austrian art, skillfully kept Austria's heritage intact (Buschbeck). Afterward, Tietze received an <em>ausserordentlicher</em> (assistant) professor appointment at Vienna and began editing the periodical <u>Die bildenden Kí_nste</u>. The next year Tietze submitted a proposal for the reorganization of Austrian museums and was appointed by Emil Fí_rster-Streffleur to the art section of the Austrian government's instruction initiatvie (í_sterreichische Staatsamt fí_r Unterricht). In 1920, too, the Tietzes consolidated their position as major public exponents of modern art by joining the Association for the Promotion of Modern Art in Vienna (Gesellschaft zur Fí_derung der modernen Kunst in Wien). Beginning in 1923, Tietze reorganized the art museum system in Vienna from its imperial arrangement to one more reflecting the popular and pedagogical direction of the new federal goverment, integrating the Hapsburg collections into existing museums. This included combining of the print collection of the Hofbibliothek into the Albertina collection and the creation of the Belvedere galleries: the baroque museum in the Lower Belvedere, the 19th-century museum in the Upper Belvedere and the modern (20th-century) art museum in the Orangerie. He worked at this successfully until 1925 when he resigned over bureaucratic frustrations. He continued as a private teacher with a titular appointment to the University with a new outlook toward art--to portray art and artists as fully real players in history and not simply producers of art (Gombrich, 1954), writing radio broadcasts on art. His knowlege of modern art and respect as a scholar allowed him to continue to advise Austrian museums on purchase of late-19th-century (\"Post-Impressionist) art. He embarked on a new assessment of Albrecht Dí_rer, joined by Erica. Volume one, <u>Der junge Dí_rer</u>, appeared in 1928, a ground-breaking work for its integration of all Dí_rer media and its \"ruthless rejection of many traditional and recent attributions\" (Gombrich, 1954). It was the new approach to Dí_rer that led him to study Venentian art, a favorite of his mentor, Wickhoff. Tietze made guest lectures to the United States in 1932 and 1935. The text for a catalog on Venetian renaissance drawings by the the pair was completed 1935 but remained unpublished until the English edition of 1944. A monograph on Titian was issued in 1936. The annexation of Austria by the Nazis in 1938 resulted in Tietze's <em>non-grata</em> status as a pacificist and of \"non-Arian\" background. While traveling in Italy, the Tietzes were forbidden to return and their home plundered. The couple fled to London and then the United States leaving their apartment in the hands of their housekeeper. Tietze secured an appointment as a visiting professor at the Toledo Museum of Art under a Carnegie Foundation support for 1938-1939. The following year the couple settled in New York city, sold their Kokoschka to the Museum of Modern Art (1939) living as private scholars. Tietze wrote introductions to European art catalogs for various regional American museums, lighter books for a general public (\"great art\" surveys and a book on forgeries) and continued his steady stream of scholarly aricles. He secured occasional assignments from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. He lectured at Columbia University on Venetian painting in the spring semester of 1954, but, already ill with cancer, was too ill to finish the class. The course was completed by Erica. He was cremated and his ashes buried under a tree at their summer home in New Boston, MA. Students greatly influenced by his teaching in Vienna included <a href=\"/gombriche\">Ernst H. Gombrich</a> and <a href=\"/kurzo\">Otto Kurz.</a> Tietze's <em>Geistesgeschichte</em> approach to art history--most clearly seen in the Dí_rer catalogs--a view of an artist as a living personality and not as an evolution of styles--was directly inherited from his Vienna School training. He was fascinated by neglected periods and genres; his early research into the Bolognese Anibale Carracci perhaps influenced the younger Kurz to write his dissertation on the (still unfashionable) baroque artist Guido Reni. The Tietzes as a scholarly couple divided their work between Hans, the theorist and actual writer of the texts and Erica who provided the details (Held). E. H. Gombrich characterized Tietze's <u>Methode der Kunstgeschichte</u> as, in addition to displaying Tietze's learning, betraying the inner crisis of art history: what, in fact, the goal of the art historian should be (Gombrich, 1954). Both Tietzes were intense driving personalities, a fact remarked upon by friends and adversaries alike. Kokoschka described his sitters as \"closed personalities so full of tension\" (MoMA). Julius Held, in a saludatory obituary, characterized Tietze as \"uncompromising\" and \"strong willed.\" This assured, unbending nature proved a detriment as much as an advantage. Tietze, who had made such significant reforms in Austrian museum culture, found himself shut out of appointments in the American Art Museum world. His lack of admiration for connoisseurship as an end--a staple of art museology--brought distrust from museum directors. \"To identify connoisseurship with art history would be like confusing detection with jurisprudence,\" he remarked (Gombrich, 1954). The offense this caused can be seen in two reviews of Tietze books by the Art Institute of Chicago associate director <a href=\"/maxonj\">John Maxon</a>, whose analysis appeared so vindictive that that Columbia scholar David Rosand (b. 1938) decried it in print as a personal vendetta by Maxon. Udo Kultermann characterized Tietze as \"one of the outstanding scholars both in the area of the art of the Renaissance and of the modern era.\"   \n",
       "146  Michelangelo scholar and Columbia University professor. Tolnay was the son of Arnold von Tolnai, an high-ranking official of the Hungarian administration of the Austro-Hungarian government. He graduated from the Staatsovergymnasium in Budapest, where he was raised, in 1918. Tolnay was a participant in the famous Budapest <em>Sonntagskreis</em> (Sunday Circle) whose members included intellectuals such as the philosopher Georg Lukíçcs (1885-1971) and art historians <a href=\"/hausera\">Arnold Hauser</a>, <a href=\"/antalf\">Frederick Antal</a>, and <a href=\"/wildej\">Johannes Wilde</a>. Beginning in 1918, Tolnay studied art history and archaeology in Berlin (under <a href=\"/goldschmidta\">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>), in Frankfurt (under <a href=\"/kautzschr\">Rudolf Kautzsch</a>) and Vienna, completing his dissertation in 1925 under the pre-eminent Vienna-School scholar <a href=\"/schlosserj\">Julius Schlosser</a>. His dissertation topic was on Hieronymous Bosch. Methodologically, however, Tolnay was as much influenced by <a href=\"/dvorakm\">Max Dvo»íçk</a>, another of the Vienna scholars. He moved to Rome, researching the topic that would become his life's major focus, Michelangelo. In 1928 he became a privatdozent associated with the University of Hamburg, coming into contact with the young <a href=\"/panofskye\">Erwin Panofsky</a> and writing his habilitation in 1929 on Michelangelo's late architecture. He married Rina Ada Clara Bartolucci in 1930. He received research grants from the Bibliotheca Hertziana for additional study in Rome. Tolnay objected to the Nazi's policies and, although not Jewish himself, he, along with many Jewish art historians, emigrated from Germany. He fled to Paris in 1933 where he worked as the Chargí© de Confí©rences at the Institut d'art et d'archí©ologie of the Sorbonne. Tolnay's 1939 book on the Master of Flí©malle, written in French during this period, established the now accepted notion that this artist is the same as the artist Robert Campin and likely the artist Jacques Daret. With Panofsky's written recommendation on his behalf, he immigrated to the United States in 1939, working at a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ, until 1948. During this time he issued the first of what would become his five-volume analysis on the work of Michelangelo, <u>The Youth of Michelangelo</u>. He become a U.S. citizen as well. After a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1948-1949, he was named a Bollingen Fellow from 1949 until 1953. In 1953 Tolnay was appointed professor at Columbia University. He completed his Michelangelo series in 1960. Tolnay retired from Columbia in 1965 to become Director of the Casa Buonarotti in Florence. As director, he presided over the museum's rescue and restoration of the artworks damaged during the disastrous 1966 flood of the Arno river. He also reorganized the object numbering system and mounted several high-profile exhibitions. Tolnay married second time, to Anna-Marie Reps, a writer and painter, in 1971. During the final years of his life, he began issuing a corpus of Michelangelo drawings, <u>Corpus dei disegni di Michelangelo</u>, the first volume of which appeared in 1975. He died at age 82 in Florence. In 1934, Panofsky wrote that Tolnay was \"one of the most brilliant art historians\" of their time (Wendland). As a connoisseur, Tolnay's attributions convinced the great Berlin scholar <a href=\"/friedlanderm\">Max J. Friedlí_nder</a> that some of Friedlí_nder's own attributions had been wrong. As a modernist, Tolnay he followed the theory of Fí_lep (whom he acknowledged) in an essay on Cí©zanne Tolnay published in Hungarian in 1924, arguing that Cí©zanne's importance was his technique of representing the fragmented world of modernity through his brushstrokes, \"which embodies the essence of form.\" (Lackí_). Tolnay was able to combine two disparate methodologies of his mentors, Goldschmidt and Dvo»íçk, into a cohesive approach, respecting both the object and a theoretical framework on which to place it (Salvini). His major work on Michelangelo was eminently readable, but suffered, according to some, from Tolnay's lack of contact with the original sources. His legacy was continued by the work of <a href=\"/ackermanj\">James Ackerman</a> (Lein).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "147  Museum director, Kassel, 1946-1961. Vogel was raised in Stettin, Germany where his father was a local merchant. After graduating from the humanistisches Gymnasium in Stettin in 1916, he entered the army in World War I where he was severely wounded. Upon recuperation in 1919 he studied political science, earning his first Ph.D. in 1923 from the university in Vienna. He entered studied thereafter in art history, attending lectures at Marburg under Richard Hamann (q.v.) and then Leipzig under Wilhelm Pinder (q.v.). His dissertation, written under Pinder, was on architects of Stettin in the eighteenth century. He volunteered at the Kunstgewerbemuseum (Arts and Crafts Museum) in Leipzig beginning in 1926. He married Suzanne Nei_er around this time. He worked for the publisher Brockhaus as an art editor briefly before being appointed an assistant at the city museum of Halle an der Saale in 1928. The following year he became an art history Dozent at the art academy in Kassel (Staatliche Kunstakademie Kassel). When the academy closed in 1932, he move to an unpaid curatorial assistant at the art museum there. Vogel's wife, because of her Jewish background, was declared a \"non-Aryan\" by the Nazis. He secured a grant to inventory the building and art of the Hohenzollern in Sigmaringen. This led to a 1936 project cataloging the print and book collection for Prince Friedrich Heinrich von Preussen in Kamenz in Schlesien, ultimately charged to liquidate some of the assets. At the end of War, Vogel was hounded by the Gestapo for his \"mixed marriage\" status to a Jew. After the War he was appointed director of the art museum at Kassel, 1946. An industrial city, Kassel suffered heavy bombing by allied forces and the museum building was heavily damaged. Vogel spent those years rebuilding the collection,the heavily damaged museum building was accomplished after his tenure. He oversaw the issuing of a catalog in 1958. He retired in 1962. Vogel's area remained neoclassicism.

       "148  Kaiser-Friedrich Museum in Berlin director, professor and scholar of early Christian art. Volbach's father was Friedrich (\"Fritz\") Volbach, a professor and orchestra conductor. The younger Volbach attended school in Mainz and Bensheim, receiving his <em>abitur</em> in 1911. After graduation, he volunteered at the Rí_misch-Germanisches Zentralmusem (Roman antiquities museum) in Mainz 1911 and 1915. He further volunteered at the Landesmuseum in Wiesbaden, reinstalling the collection when the director was killed in World War I. During this same period, Volbach studied archaeology, art history and medieval history at the universities of Munich, Berlin (under <a href=\"/goldschmidta\">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>), Tí_bingen (under <a href=\"/langek\">Konrad von Lange</a>) and finally Gieíôen (Giessen) under <a href=\"/rauchc\">Christian Rauch</a>. He wrote his dissertation in 1916 under Rauch at Giessen on the topic of the figure of St. George in medieval German art. The Kaiser-Friedrich Museum director <a href=\"/bodew\">Wilhelm Bode</a> hired him for his museum in 1917. With <a href=\"/vitzthumg\">Count Georg von Vitzthum</a> he authored the <u>Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft</u> volume on Italian medieval art. At the Museum he collaborated with Ernst F. Bange (1893-?) and Theodor Demmler on the catalog for the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. During this time he became a founding member and lecturer at the Volkshochschule in Berlin. Volbach was interested in the contemporary art scene in Berlin and knew many of <em>Die Brí_cke</em> German Expressionists. He married Maria Luise Adelung (d. 1936) in 1928. The same year he met the Byzantinist <a href=\"/duthuitg\">Georges Duthuit</a>. In 1929 he was raised to curator (Kustos) and in 1930 head of the Early Christian and medieval Italian collection. He, Duthuit and <a href=\"/sallesg\">Georges Salles</a> collaborated on a book on Byzantine art in 1933. He was named professor in 1933 at the Volkshochschule but the same year determined to be \"non-Aryan\" (Volbach's mother was of Jewish extraction) by the new Nazi government. He and his wife, both practicing Roman Catholics, immigrated to the Vatican City in 1934. There he worked in the Vatican library and as a professor at the Papal Institute for Christian Archaeology. Volbach participated on anti-fascist committees with C. B. Todd and Ludwig Muckermann. He returned to Germany after the War in 1946. In 1948 he married a second time to Australian writer Vivyan Eyles (b. 1910), only recently divorced the writer and art historian <a href=\"/prazm\">Mario Praz</a>. He was appointed the director of the antiquities museum in Mainz. He retired in 1958, mounting a show on Coptic Christian art at the Villa Hí_gel in Essen in 1963. He collaborated with <a href=\"/hubertj\">Jean Hubert</a> and<a href=\"/porcherj\"> Jean Porcher</a> in the important L'Univers des formes art-history series, <u>L'Europe des invasions</u> in 1967 and and volume three of the Propylí_en Kunstgeschichte series.

       "150  Professor of art history, Basel [1933]; Heinrich Wí_lfflin (q.v.) friend; Vienna School; contributed to an early-twentieth century re-evaluation of the Baroque style. Weisbach was a student of Robert Vischer (q.v.). In 1924 Weisbach wrote the volume for the prestigious <u>Propylí_en Kunstgeschichte</u> on baroque art, which he dedicated to theologian Ernst Troeltsch (1865-1923). Weisbach was one of the first to write an analysis of Italian Mannerism. While he did not appreciate it as an art movement (as Walter Friedlí_nder, q.v., would beginning in his 1914 inaugural lecture at Freiburg), he made the connection with the abstracting and stylizing techniques of his own era, German Expressionism. His students included Richard Krautheimer (q.v.), who wrote his dissertation under him.

       "151  Princeton scholar, influential Byzantinist and medievalist. Weitzman was the son of Wilhelm Weitzman, a city school superintendent, and Antoine Keiper. Weitzmann initially attended courses in the dominant art historical periods of that time, ancient and renaissance art at the universities of Mí_nster, Wí_rzburg and Vienna. His professors included the eminent of that time: <a href=\"/wackernagelm\">Martin Wackernagel</a>, <a href=\"/salisa\">Arnold von Salis</a>, the theologian Adolf von Harnack (1851-1930), and Vienna-School giants <a href=\"/schlosserj\">Julius von Schlosser</a>, <a href=\"/strzygowski\">Josef Strzygowski</a>, <a href=\"/swobodak\">Karl Maria Swoboda</a>, and <a href=\"/lowye\">Emanuel Lí_wy</a>. Weitzmann completed his education in Berlin under the distinguished archaeological art historian <a href=\"/noackf\">Ferdinand Noack</a> and the eminent medievalist art historian <a href=\"/goldschmidta\">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>. Goldschmidt directed Weitzmann's 1929 dissertation on ivory rosette caskets, <u>Die Elfenbeinkí_sten aus der mittelbyzantinsichen Zeit</u>, which he and Weitzmann published as the first volume of Goldschmidt's corpus of medieval ivories, <u>Die byzantinischen Elfenbeinskulpturen des X.-XIII. Jahrhunderts</u>. Weitzmann collaborated on the second volume of the series as well as his <i>Habilitation</i> under Goldschmidt. During these years Weitzmann was a member of the Deutsches Archí_ologischen Institut in Berlin (1930-1934), using a stipend from that body for research in Athens, Patmos and Mount Athos (1931) and Berlin (1932-1934). In 1932 he married fellow Goldschmidt student Josepha Fiedler (1904-2000). Although not Jewish himself, his association with Goldschmidt, a Jew, and his refusal to join the Nazi party in order to teach as a <i>Dozent</i> at the University mandated his leaving Germany. He left Berlin for Princeton University in 1935, where he remained the rest of his life teaching and writing. His wife followed in 1938. At Princeton, he was a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study, initially engaged in preparing a corpus of illustrated manuscripts of the Septuagint with <a href=\"/moreyc\">Charles Rufus Morey</a> and <a href=\"/frienda\">Albert M. Friend, Jr.</a>. In 1938 he began his long association with Dumbarton Oaks, Harvard's research center for Byzantine studies, presenting the paper, \"Principals of Byzantine Book Illumination,\" even before the center was fully established. In 1945, he succeeded Morey as professor in the department of art history. He and Friend conducted a manuscript seminar until Weitzmann's retirement. His most influential book, <u>Illustrations in Roll and Codex</u>, a distillation of his principles of manuscript interpretation, appeared in 1947 (later revised and reissued in 1970). He held visiting positions at Yale (1954-55). In 1956 he began his long research association with the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mt. Sinai. On his first visit he examined and photographed 2,000 manuscripts. Subsequent visits were sponsored by the Alexandria-Michigan-Princeton Expedition directed by <a href=\"/forsythg\">George Forsyth</a>. In 1960 he was visiting professor at Alexandria University. Weitzmann presented a manuscript seminar at the Universití_t Bonn in 1962. Together with <a href=\"/kitzingere\">Ernst Kitzinger</a> he organized the 1965 Dumbarton Oaks conference on Byzantine contribution to the art of the West of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. A second edition of his <u>Illustrations in Roll and Codex</u> appeared in 1970. Named emeritus in the department in 1972, he relinquished his Institute appointment to be a visiting scholar at Dumbarton Oaks, 1972-1974. In 1977, Weitzmann organized an exhibition and symposium (with Margaret Frazer) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, entitled, \"The Age of Spirituality.\" The show recapped Weitzmann's originality in looking at the range of early medieval objects which both showed the unity of the objects and the adoption of pagen images into new meanings. Although the icons of St. Catherine's had been published in cursory form, Weitzmann's enthusiasm for them and the place they played in religious iconography resulted a longer treatment. With George Forsyth he issued <u>The Monastery of Saint Catherine on Mount Sinai</u>. volume one on <u>The Church and Fortress  of Justinian</u>, 1973 and a second volume of the Monastery, <u>The Icons</u>, 1976, the former a result of Weitzmann's supervission of the restoration of the Transfiguration mosaic of St. Catherine's. A book on <u>The Frescoes of the Dura Synagogue and Christian Art</u> co-authored with another of his students, <a href=\"/kesslerh\">Herbert Kessler</a> appeared in 1990. That year, too, his research on illuminations of the St. Catherine's Monastery research began to appear in book form. The first, published in collaboration with another former student, <a href=\"/galavarisg\">George Galavaris</a>, was <u>The Illuminated Greek Manuscripts from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century</u> His eyesight gone and his health failing rapidly in the spring of 1993, Weitzmann was conferred an honorary Doctor of Letters at bedside shortly before his death. Weitzmann was responsible for training many of the leading medievalists of the next generation. His students, in addition to Galavaris and Kessler, included Paul Underwood, <a href=\"/martinj\">John Rupert Martin</a>, <a href=\"/eitnerl\">Lorenz Eitner</a>, <a href=\"/kochra\">Robert Koch</a>, <a href=\"/hovingt\">Thomas Hoving</a>, <a href=\"/grabaro\">Oleg Grabar</a>, <a href=\"/snyderj\">James Snyder</a>, <a href=\"/kelinbauerw\">W. Eugene Kleinbauer</a>, and Robert P. Bergman. <u>Roll and Codex</u> illustrates Weitzmann's brilliance and methodology. Through precise visual analysis and archaeological evidence, he traced an evolution of illustrated manuscripts in the early Christian and Byzantine era, theorizing two turning points, Egyptian \"papyrus style\" and Greek \"continuous narrative\" style. From these two types, Weitzmann created a method of interpreting extant illustrations. In a 1990 Dumbarton Oaks publication, <u>The Frescoes of the Dura Synagogue and Christian Art</u>, he argued effectively that Christian symbolism, rather than emerging from a slow progression on its own, developed from a Jewish tradition of images adopted from a classical vocabulary. His encounter with Crusader icons at St. Catherine's buttressed Weitzmann's conviction to study all of medieval art, which he did in numerous articles and lectures. His legacy to early medieval art was foremost not to see a rigid division between east and west.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "152  Scholar of modernist art, authority on collage, art critic. Kauert's parents were Heinrich Kauert, a merchant, and Maria Jentges (Kauert). She attended the Lyceum and was tutored privately, receiving her abitur in 1917 in Bonn. She immediately began studying art history, history and archaeology at the Universities of Heidelberg, Munich (under <a href=\"/wolfflinh\">Heinrich Wí_lfflin</a>) and Freiburg. In Munich, she made close friendships with many who would become important art historians, including Wí_lfflin students <a href=\"/rohf\">Franz Roh</a>, <a href=\"/curjelh\">Hans Curjel</a>, <a href=\"/giedions\">Siegried Giedion</a>, and <a href=\"/giedionwelckerc\">Carola [Giedion-]Welcker</a>. This group--all modern art enthusiasts--instilled a passion for modern art in her as well. At Freiburg Kauert studied under <a href=\"/jantzenh\">Hans Jantzen</a>. She met and married the Jantzen student <a href=\"/wescherp\">Paul Wescher</a> in 1923, adopting his surname professionally. She received her Ph.D. in Freiburg (almost certainly under Jantzen) in 1924, writing her dissertation on the 16th-century painter Sebastian Dayg. After graduation, her husband secured a position at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (State Museum in Berlin) and she volunteered at the graphics division there as well, working under <a href=\"/friedlanderm\">Max Friedlí_nder</a>. Through Friedlí_nder she secured a position with the scholar assembling the Peter Paul Rubens <i>catalogue raisonn</i><i>í©</i>, <a href=\"/burchardl\">Ludwig Burchard</a>. Wescher became involved in the comtemporary art scene in Berlin, both through Roh, <a href=\"/glaserc\">Curt Glaser</a>, Curjel and the artist Líçszlí_ Moholy-Nagy. Strong supporters of the Weimar Republic and the Bauhaus school of architecture, she and her husband's views were directly opposed to the conservative art ideology of national socialism. With the accession to power of Hitler in 1933 the couple moved to Paris. Wescher worked as a journalist and, between 1936-1937, as a correspondent for the English art magazine <u>Axis</u>. She helped organize the Freier Kí_nstlerbund, among whose members were the art historians Sabine Spiro and <a href=\"/westheimp\">Paul Westheim</a>. With France's entrance into World War II, she was interned in 1940. She and her husband fled to Switzerland in 1942, settling in Basle. At the conclusion of the war, she separated from her husband, returning to Paris in 1945. Wescher wrote freelance articles and in the early 1950s for <u>Art d'Aujourd'hui</u>. In 1953 she helped found the journal <u>Cimaise</u>. Among her topics at this time were collage. Wescher wrote a major monograph on the art form in 1968, <u>Die Collage</u>. She died of a heart attack at age 72. .Wescher's career eclipsed that of her husband's, prinicipally through her specialty in the relatively unpublished area of collage. She became an authority on it and an early exponent of non-figurative art. The New York Times termed her book on collage \"a definitive summing up on that major technique in [the] 20th century.\" She and the Museum of Modern Art's <a href=\"/seitzw\">William Seitz</a> (through his 1961 show and book <u>Art of Assemblage</u>) were the two main theorist until the late 20th century.

       "153  Museum director of early J. Paul Getty Museum, 1953-1959. Wescher was the son of Paul Wescher, M.D., and Elsa Mez (Wescher). He attended a humanites Gymnasium in Freiburg, volunteering for World War I (fighting in field artillery) where he received his abitur in 1918. After the war studied art history, archaeology and literature in Freiburg and Munich beginning in 1919. Wescher studied under the major art historians of the time, including <a href=\"/wolfflinh\">Heinrich Wí_lfflin</a>, <a href=\"/franklp\">Paul Frankl</a> and <a href=\"/mayera\">August L. Mayer</a>, in Munich and then at Freibrug under <a href=\"/friedlanderw\">Walter Friedlí_nder</a> and <a href=\"/jantzenh\">Hans Jantzen</a>. He completed his dissertation under Jantzen in 1923 writing on an aspect of manuscript illumination before the fourteenth century. The same year he married a fellow art historian <a href=\"/wescherh\">Hertha Kauert [Wescher]</a>. Wescher initially worked as a volunteer at the Augustiner-Museum in Freiburg, 1919-1921 before securing a job as a curatorial assistant at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (State Museum in Berlin), 1924-1927, where his wife also volunteered. In 1927 he was appointed to the graphics collection cataloging Flemmish drawings, publishing a catalog, <u>Beschreibendes Verzeichnis der Miniaturen Handschriften</u> in 1931. His strong objection to Hitler's rise to power in 1933 resulted in his leaving Germany on political grounds in 1934, moving to Paris. There he researched and worked as an art dealer through 1939. He moved to Campione am Lugano, Switzerland that year as a private scholar and teacher, writing books (most notibly, one on Renaissance Merchants) and as a commissioned author for the Basel publisher Holbein-Verlag. The couple divorced around this time. He published a major monograph on the French Renaissance painter Jean Fouquet, <u>Jean Fouquet und seine Zeit</u> in 1945. After the war, Wescher's career would be inextricably connected to his friend, the former Detroit Institute of Art director <a href=\"/valentinerw\">Wilhelm (William) Valentiner</a>. Valentiner had the Detroit Institute of Arts hire Wescher as a research associate at the Museum and Wescher immigrated to the United States in 1948. Wescher followed Valentiner as an assistant to Valentiner's postions at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. There, Wescher was picked in 1953 to be the director of the art collection the Oklahoma billionaire J. Paul Getty (1892-1976) was assembling in Santa Monica, CA. The collection at that time amounted to mostly second-rate baroque artists because of Getty's unwillingness to pay high prices for art, but a spectacular collection of French decorative art. He remarried again (Mary Wescher). He resigned from the Getty in 1959, working as a private researcher, curating exhibitions in the U.S., most notably, at the North Carolina Museum of Art under <a href=\"/byrnesj\">James B. Byrnes</a> (where Valentiner had been its first director) and at the New Orleans Museum of Art. He died at his California home in 1974. His research on the art-thefts of Napoleon was published posthumously in 1976.  Wescher was a scholar of Flemmish art though his principle book publication were in other areas. His book on Jean Fouquet was termed definitive by the <u>Burlington Magazine</u>. He was among the generation of \"discovery art historians,\" whose numbers included <a href=\"/bodew\">Wilhelm Bode</a>, <a href=\"/friedlanderm\">Max Friedlí_nder</a>, and <a href=\"/winklerf\">Friedrich Winkler</a>, scholars who through stylistic analysis compiled oeuvre catalogs of artists establishing a body of work (Otten).

       "154  Director of the Kunsthalle, Mannheim; early exponent of modern art in Germany. Wichert attended various gymnasiums in Prussian cities where his father, Friedrich Wichert, was stationed as an officer in the Prussian military, together with his mother was Fanny Klumpp (Wichert). After receiving an <em>abitur</em> from the Wiesbaden Realgymnasium in 1899, studied art history and Philosophy at Freiburg, Basel (under Heinrich A. Schmid, q.v.), Berlin and eventually again at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universití_t, Freiburg, where he was awarded his Ph.D. in 1907. His dissertation, written under Heinrich Wí_lfflin (q.v.), was on the topic of representation in medieval Italian art. Wichert joined the Stí_dtische Galerie under its director, Georg Swarzenski (q.v.). He married a Dutch woman, Margarete Brouwer (d. 1921) in 1908. Wichert contributed reviews to the <u>Frankfurter Zeitung</u> as well. In 1909 he became director of the Kunsthalle in Mannheim, Germany where he set about purchasing French and German art of the 19th and 20th century. Among his famous purchases was the Manet painting \"The Execution of Maximilian.\" He hired the young Gustav Hartlaub (q.v.) as a curator in 1913. The two mounted many epoch-making exhibitions of modern art and founding an association for art (Freien Bundes zur Einbí_rgerung der Bildenden Kunst). After the death of his first wife, he married a woman of English/Jewish extraction, Margarete Wetzlar-Coit in 1922. The following year he was called to be director of the Stí_delschule in Frankfurt, the art school for the Stí_delsches Kunstinstitut, succeeded at Mannheim by Hartlaub. Wichert transformed the school into the most important arts-and-crafts technical school in Germany (Wendland). Between 1924 and 1930 he was involved with historic preservation for Wiesbaden. With the Nazi's rise to power in Germany in 1933, Wichert was denounced as a Bolshevik sympathizer for his modern art preferences. Pressures because of his wife's Jewish background (her father was a baptized British Jew) forced her and his daughter to flee to England. Wichert allowed her to divorce him and assume the name Wickham in order to spare them anti-German prejudice. Wichert himself retired to Keiten auf Sylt in 1934. After the war, Wichert was elected mayor of Kampen auf Sylt. His two marriages resulted in six children.

       "155  Michelangelo scholar and Deputy Director of the Courtauld Institute, professor 1950-58. Wilde was raised in Hungary. His parents were Richard Wilde (1840-1912) and Rosalie Somjíçgy (Wilde) (1854-1928). He attended the State Gymnasium in Budapest before the University of Budapest, 1909-1913 where he studied art, archaeology and philosophy, then one semester at the University of Freiburg before settling at the University of Vienna, 1915-1917. In Vienna he studied under Vienna-school scholar <a href=\"/dvorakm\">Max Dvo»íçk</a>, with whom he wrote his doctorate in 1918 on early Italian etching. Since 1914 he had been a volunteer at the department of prints at the Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest. In 1918 he was promoted to Assistant Curator at the Museum. There he was a member of the so-called Budapest Sunday Circle (Budapester Sonntagskreis) whose members included <a href=\"/antalf\">Fredrick Antal</a>, <a href=\"/hausera\">Arnold Hauser</a> and <a href=\"/tolnayc\">Charles de Tolnay</a>. In 1922 he moved permanently to Vienna where he was an assistant at the Gemí_ldegalerie of the Kunsthistorischen Museums, under the direction of the talented <a href=\"/gluckg\">Gustav Glí_ck</a>. In Vienna he collaborated with <a href=\"/swobodak\">Karl Maria Swoboda</a> in editing the collected works of Dvo»íçk. In 1923 he became Assistant Keeper, then Keeper of the Gemí_ldegalerie, where he was an early exponent of the use of x-rays for painting conservation. He became an Austrian citizen in 1928. In 1930 Wilde married the art historian Julia Gyíçrfíçs (d. 1970). Although Wilde was Roman Catholic, his Jewish wife was in jeopardy when the Nazis rose to power in 1933. The couple left for Holland in 1939 and then, as guests of <a href=\"/clarkk\">Sir Kenneth Clark</a> went to Aberystwyth, Wales, to consult for his former student, <a href=\"/seilerundaspanga\">Count Antoine Seilern und Aspang</a> on his collection. Wilde also assisted in cataloging the pictures of the National Gallery, where the London paintings were stored for safekeeping. Wilde was asked by the Keeper of Prints and Drawings <a href=\"/pophama\">Arthur E. Popham</a> of the British Museum to write a catalog of old master drawings at Windsor Castle in 1939. When World War II broke out, the Wilde's were interned and deported to an alien camp in Canada for the years 1940-1941, erroneously charged with signaling enemy submarines. They returned to England in 1941 where Wilde resumed his work on the Windsor Castle catalog. At the same time he began lecturing at the Courtauld Institute. He became a Reader in the History of Art there in 1947. The following year he advanced to Deputy Director of the Courtauld Institute of Art which he held until 1958. He was professor of History of Art beginning in 1950. He became emeritus in 1958. His students included <a href=\"/shearmanj\">John Shearman</a> and <a href=\"/borsooke\">Eve Borsook</a>. Wilde published comparatively little and never allowed his lectures to be printed in his lifetime (his Michelangelo lectures appeared in 1978). Early on he was influenced by the work of the philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911), especially evident in Wilde's empirical approach to studying the object (Shearman). Wilde's scholarship on Michelangelo is some of his finest, his Windsor Castle collection catalog dispelled many myths about the artist. Wilde was an equal authority on Venetian art, a reputation he had already built during his years at the Gemí_ldegalerie in Vienna.

       "156  Iconologist specializing in the Renaissance era; and interdisciplinary art historian; first professor of art history at Oxford University. Wind learned classical languages along with French, English, and his native German at the Kaiser-Friedrich-Schule, a <i>humanistisches Gymnasium</i> in Charlottenburg. He studied jointly philosophy and art history at various Germanic universities: three semesters in Berlin under <a href=\"/goldschmidta\">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>, one in Freiburg with Edmund Husserl (1859-1938) and Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), and Vienna with <a href=\"/dvorakm\">Max Dvo»íçk</a>, <a href=\"/schlosserj\">Julius von Schlosser</a>, and <a href=\"/strzygowski\">Josef Strzygowski</a>. In 1920 he moved to the new university in Hamburg (begun in 1919) where he was the first student to write a dissertation under <a href=\"/panofskye\">Erwin Panofsky</a>, then a 28-year-old <i>privatdozent</i>, and supervised by the philosopher/art historian <a href=\"/cassirere\">Ernst Cassirer</a>. His topic was on art-historical method. To escape the economic depression gripping Germany, Wind traveled to New York in 1924, initially staying with a cousin. He was appointed Graham Kenan Fellow in philosophy at the University of North Carolina, teaching there 1925-1927. Returning to Hamburg, Wind took a job as a research assistant at the Warburg Library, and wrote his <i>habilitation</i> under Cassirer in philosophy, employing the philosophy of Charles Sanders Pierce (1839-1914), whose work he had read in America. Wind's initial methodological influence had been that of Cassirer through Panofsky, but his close personal relationship with <a href=\"/warburga\">Aby Warburg</a> brought him nearer to the \"cultural history\" approach of Warburg as well as the work of Pierce. Wind became a <i>privatdozent</i> at Hamburg, 1930-1933. With the advent of Nazism in Germany, Wind, a Jew, played a key role in moving the Warburg library to London along with himself and, with <a href=\"/wittkowerr\">Rudolf Wittkower</a>, founded the <u> Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institute</u> in 1937. Throughout the second World War, Wind taught at universities in the United States, (New York University, 1940-1942 and the University of Chicago, 1942-1944) and eleven years at Smith College, 1944-1955. In 1954 Wind was asked to deliver the Chichele Lectures at All Souls College, Oxford, on the topic \"Art and Scholarship under Julius II.\" These resulted in a 1955 appointment as the first Professorship of art history at Oxford (under the Faculty of Modern History). In 1960 Wind delivered radio lectures for the BBC, the Reith lectures, which later became his book <u>Art and Anarchy</u>. His Oxford colleagues had difficulty appreciating Wind's philosophical propensities, his adulation of Cassierer and the post Hegelians (McConica). At Oxford he garnered the support of the classicist Richard Livingstone (1880-1960) (soon to be president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford) the medievalist Ernest Jacob (1894-1971), Chichele chair for medieval history All Souls College, and the classicist C. Maurice Bowra (1898-1971) of Wadham College. Wind also enjoyed the friendship of <a href=\"/seznecj\">Jean Seznec</a>, an art historian occupying the Marshall Foch Chair for french literature at All Souls College. Wind retired emeritus from Oxford in 1967. Though Wind was considered a classicist and Renaissance expert, he staunchly defended modern art, unlike many of his colleagues. Wind's name is most closely connected with his research in allegory and the use of pagan mythology during the 15th-16th centuries and his book of essays on the topic, <u>Pagan Mysteries of the Renaissance</u>. In <u>Art and Anarchy</u>, Wind argued that the height of art's powers to portray an idea had occurred in the Renaissance. The Romantic era's distrust that knowledge interfered with imagination had destroyed the acumen in modern viewers. Wind fits no traditional academic classification and is one of the prime examples of the intellectual tradition of Warburg's blend of mythological/psychological approach to art history. One of his students, <a href=\"/hecksherw\">William S. Heckscher</a>, referred to Wind as a \"magician\" for his brilliance as an art historian. His papers are housed at Oxford.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "157  East-Asianist art historian and museum curator, Strzygowski student, dismissed by Nazis, later taught at UCLA. After brief periods of study at Munich and Freiburg, With met and assisted Karl Ernst Osthaus (q.v.), who later founded the Folkwang-Museum in Hagen, at the Museum fí_r Kunst in Handel und Gewerbe in 1911. The next year he began studies with Josef Strzygowski (q.v.) at the University of Vienna where he specialized in Asian art. His dissertation in 1918 was on Buddhist sculpture in Japan. He acted as director of the Folkwang Museum 1919-21 and as curator for the collection of Baron von der Heyt in Amsterdam 1920-23. In 1928 Konrad Adenauer, then mayor of Cologne, appointed him director of the Kunstgewerbe-Museum of that city. Dismissed from his post by the Nazis in 1933 and singled out in the infamous \"Enartete Kunst\" (Degenerate Art) exhibition of 1937 as a \"literary pimp\" of the degenerate forms of art, Baron von der Heydt once again hired him in 1936 to purchase Asian and African art in Ascona. In 1939 With emigrated to the U.S. where, with one exception, he spent the remainder of his life. During World War II With taught in Pasadena and at the Black Mountain College in North Carolina. In the first year afterward, he was director of the Modern Institute of Art in Beverly Hills. From 1950-62 he was professor of Art History at UCLA. With combined an interest in the value of common objects as art and a connoisseur's approach to Asian art.

       "158  Scholar of Italian baroque art. Seminal figure for the generation of art historians who matured during the second half of the 20th century. Because Wittkower's father, Henry Wittkower (1865-1942), was British, the younger Wittkower held British citizenship his whole life despite having been born and raised in Germany. His mother was a German, Gertrude Ansbach (Wittkower) (1876-1965). After graduating from the humanistic Friedrichs Gymnasium in Berlin, Wittkower studied (practicing) architecture for a year in Berlin before deciding to changed to art history under <a href=\"/wolfflinh\">Henrich Wí_lfflin</a> in Munich. Wí_lfflin proved to be a very detached professor, and, unhappy with his teaching, Wittkower returned to Berlin to study under <a href=\"/goldschmidta\">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>. He completed his dissertation there on the subject of Domenico Morone. In 1923 he moved to Rome to assist <a href=\"/steinmanne\">Ernst Steinmann</a>, director of the Herziana, with completion of the <u>Michelangelo-Bibliographie 1510-1926</u>. The same year he married Margot Holzmann (<a href=\"/wittkowerm\">Margot Wittkower</a>) who was to assist him with some of his later scholarship. In between, Wittkower contributed many entries for artists in the <u>Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden Kí_nstler</u> (the so-called \"Thieme-Becker\"). He was elevated at the Biblioteca Herziana to a research fellow, remaining there until 1927. Wittkower returned to Berlin but continued his association with the Herziana, publishing in 1931 with <a href=\"/bauerh\">Heinrich Brauer</a> a survey of drawings by Bernini. The publication put him at the fore of an ideological battle (both esthetically and politically) with the major Austrian art historian, <a href=\"/sedlmayrh\">Hans Sedlmayr</a>. Sedlmayr criticized Wittkower in a published review, for belonging to neither of the two genres of art history that Sedlmayr found acceptable. The public exchange drew a distinction between Sedlmayer's <i>Gestaltungsprinzipien</i> [abstract principles] approach to art history (as well as his anti-Jewish Nazi sympathies) and Wittkower's approach. After briefly teaching as a <em>Privatdozent</em> at the Univeristy in Cologne in 1932-1933, Wittkower was forced to leave Germany--now fully under the control of the Nazis, whose laws forbade university positions to Jews--abandoning any <em>habilitationschrift</em> for the London and the Warburg Institute. In London he was founding co-editor of the <u>Journal of the Warburg Institute</u> (renamed in 1940 to <u>The Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes</u>) in 1937, remaining at the Institute between 1934-1956. His position at the Institute allowed outside lecturing, such as his 1946 Courtauld Institute talks on the architecture of Vittone. Proof of his broad interests, when he first proposed the lectures to his host, <a href=\"/blunta\">Anthony Blunt</a>, Blunt believed Wittkower joking and had invented the architect's name. In 1948 the young Italian scholar <a href=\"/salernol\">Luigi Salerno</a> studied with Wittkower on a Warburg fellowship. Wittkower began publishing his research, first begun as his intended <em>habilitation</em> in the 1930s, on Palladio and Alberti, in <u>Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes</u>. These studies, expanded and broadened, were published in 1949 as his most significant book, <u>Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism</u>. Formal pedagogical duties also began that year when he was appointed to be Durning Lawrence professor at the Slade School of Art, although these were limited largely to advising dissertations. Wittkower's dedication to drawings as a scholarly tool continued. He collaborated with several other eminent art historians to produce books on Sir Robert Mond's collection (with <a href=\"/boreniust\">Tancred Borenius</a>), drawings of Poussin (with Anthony Blunt, from a manuscript of <a href=\"/friedlanderw\">Walter Friedlaender</a>). In 1952 he published a catalog of Carracci drawings from Windsor Castle. Wittkower was visiting professor of art history at Harvard University in 1954. This solidified a move to the United States, where he became chair of the Department of Art History and Archaeology at Columbia University in 1956. In addition to lecturing at Columbia, Wittkower reorganized the Department, adding, among appointments, the first lecturer in Near Eastern art. Here, too, he wrote two of his most popular books, <u>Art and Architecture in Italy: 1600-1750</u> (1958) and, in collaboration with his wife, <u>Born Under Saturn </u>(1963). <u>Art and Architecture in Italy</u>, volume 16 of the \"Pelican History of Art\" was (and remains) the publisher's best-selling volume of the series. A magisterial synthesis of a period of vast artistic output, Wittkower updated it three times. It received the Bannister Fletcher Prize for architectural writing. Wittkower retired from Columbia in 1969 as Avalon Foundation Professor Emeritus of Art History. During his final years, he held the Kress Professorship at the National Gallery of Art and Slade Professor at Cambridge. He delivered the Charles T. Mathews lectures for 1971-1972 which appeared as the book <u>Gothic vs. Classic: Architectural Projects in Seventeenth-century Italy</u>. After his death he received Alice Davis Hitchcock Award in 1975. He supervised many Ph.D. dissertations including <a href=\"/seklere\">Eduard Sekler</a> (at the Warburg), <a href=\"/pepperd\">D. Stephen Pepper</a> and <a href=\"/rowec\">Colin Rowe</a>. Another student also became a colleague of his at Columbia university, <a href=\"/hibbardh\">Howard Hibbard</a>, whose methodology Hibbard closely reflected. His scholarly tradition was most clearly continued in the work of <a href=\"/connorsj\">Joseph Connors</a>. In terms of method, Wittkower certainly differed from Sedlmayr. Compared to Sedlmayr's psychological-theoretic approach of the same material, Wittkower, in the words of <a href=\"/clarkk\">Kenneth Clark,</a> disposed of, \"the hedonist, or purely aesthetic, theory of Renaissance architecture.\" Not that Wittkower eschewed psychology (two of his books used this approach principally) rather, he preferred to allow documents to connect psychological patterns he used rather than vice versa. Like Goldschmidt, he discounted the Hegelian view of art history so common among German art historians of his and previous generations. <a href=\"/krautheimerr\">Richard Krautheimer</a> described Wittkower's art history as one blending mathematics and philosophy, the religious and cultural climate with the interrelations of patron and artist. Even the Warburg scholar <a href=\"/saxlf\">Fritz Saxl</a>, who admitted in a 1934 letter that Wittkower's ideas on the history of art were much different from his own, concluded that Wittkower's \"struggle for clear-shaped logical notions in art history has undoubted merits.\" <u>Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism</u> remains his most influential writing, having immediately influenced works as disparate as <u>Die Kunst der Renaissance in Italien</u> (1953) by <a href=\"/paatzw\">Walter Paatz</a>, Ezra Ehrenkrantz's <u>The Modular Number Pattern</u> (1956) and P. H. Scholfield's The <u>Theory of Proportion in Architecture</u> (1958). The book, however caught the scorn of <a href=\"/paner\">Roberto Pane</a> who attacked Wittkower's ideas at the Eighteenth International Congress of the History of Art (Venice) in 1956 (Wittkower, 1973). In 1961 Wittkower presented a paper at Winterthur, Delaware, on \"Art History as a Discipline\" which demonstrated his affinity for the work of <a href=\"/panofskye\">Erwin Panofsky</a> and decrying the extreme connoisseurship of <a href=\"/fryr\">Roger Fry</a>. The esthetician Joseph Masheck insightfully contrasted Panofsky with Wittkower, both fellow Warburg Institute scholars: \"Panofsky mainly pursued a history of illustrated concepts . . . that have taken roost . . . [in] datable objects.\" Wittkower, on the other hand, he contended, is the \"ultra-Warburgian,\" not limited to the classical tradition but employing a cosmopolitan view of art.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "159  University of Uppsala professor 1965-1977. Zeitler's parents were Eugen Zeitler (1880-1922), an engineer, and Elsa Kí_hn (Zeitler) (1884-1922). Both parents were killed in a mountaineering accident in Berchtesgaden when Zeitler was ten; he was subsequently raised by his maternal grandfather in Kaiserslautern, Germany. He attended the Cologne and Kaiserslautern high schools (gymnasium) graduating in 1930. The same year he began study of history and art history in Munich, Marburg (under <a href=\"/hamannr\">Richard Hamann</a>), and Berlin. Because his mother was a converted Jew, Zeitler was forced to flee Germany after Hitler's rise to power in 1933. He first fled to Czechoslovakia in that year continuing study in Prague. He was granted a Ph.D. in history from Prague in 1936, writing a dissertation on Sophicles and the polis under Victor Ehrenberg (1891-1976). In 1937, pending the annexation of that country to Germany, Zeitler moved to Sweden, teaching in the Gymnasium in Uppsala. Zeitler found a mentor in the Uppsala University art historian <a href=\"/paulssong\">Gregor Paulsson</a>, publishing a monograph on Albrecht Dí_rer in 1946. He married Hannelore Gí_nthert (b. 1919), an historian, the following year. Zeitler published his habilitation, <u>Klassizismus und Utopia</u>, written under Paulsson, in 1954. He taught as a privatdozent until his appointment as professor at the University in 1964. Zeitler used his classical education write on the comparatively neglected area of nineteenth-century Neo-classicism. He edited <u>Figura</u> between 1965 and 1977. In 1966 he and Anders íman published a ground-breaking volume on nineteenth-century art in the <u>Propylí_en Kunstgeschichte</u> series. Unlike many earlier surveys, it treated Neo-classicism as a significant art movement and not simply a dry precursor to Realism and Impressionism. He emphasized artistic theory of the era as a way to understand the art, an approach critized by some was ignoring truly popular taste. Zeitler eschewed the emerging post-war Warburg-school tradition of <a href=\"/panofskye\">Erwin Panofsky</a> that used iconographical interpretation. Instead he approached the period as a characteristic, multinational expression of its particular time in history (íman, <u>NZZ</u> 2005). Zeitler's most important book, <u>Klassizismus und Utopia</u>, emphasized Neo-classicism as the embodiment of significant bourgeois values, including utopian/dystopian views, which formed the basis for modern populist art. His rehabilitation of many neglected masterpieces of the years around 1800 marked an important revisionist approach to art history. His characterizing of the period as a dialectic, \"Kontrasterlebnis\" was adopted by other scholars of the nineteenth century, notably <a href=\"/hofmannw\">Werner Hofmann</a>. He personally viewed his work as a continuation of the German-Jewish tradition of scholarship (íman <u>NZZ</u> 2005).

The younger Zucker attended the Wilhelms-Gymnasium, a humanities high school in Berlin where he graduated in 1907. He studied architecture at the Institute of Technology (Kí_nigliche Technische Hochschule) receiving the Diplom-Ingenieur in 1911 and Doktor-Ingenieurs in 1913 in the history of architecture under Richard Borrmann (q.v.). His dissertation was on the topic of pictorial space in Florentine painting. Between 1912-14 he was an assistant to Max Georg Zimmermann (q.v.) at the Schinkel Museum. He married the concert singer Rose Walter (1890-1962) in 1913. After a year teaching at the Reimann Schule in Berlin, 1914, Zucker joined the faculty in art history as a lecturer (Dozent) at the Lessing Hochschule, 1916-35. He practiced architecture in Berlin between 1919-35, much of it as a city planner. He lectured on architecture in radio broadcasts. His interest in stage design led to his association with avant-garde theatre groups. Among his commissions were the Prussian Bank and many country homes. Zucker was Dean of the Faculty at the Lessing Hochschule, 1930-33. In 1937 he was dismissed from his position by the Nazis because he was a Jew. His journal articles of those last years were sign with initials only to avoid recognition. Zucker emigrated to the United States the same year began teaching at the New School for Social Research in New York, then known as the \"University in Exile.\" He also lectured at the Fashion Institute, the Dramatic Workshop, and Pratt Institute, Brooklyn in the 1940s and 1950s. He remained at the New School until 1970. In 1938 he was appointed lecturer at the Cooper Union, then Adjunct Professor in 1948. He became an American citizen in 1944. In 1950 Zucker published his Styles in Art, a popular treatment of stylistic analysis in art. He retired in 1963 but retained Visiting Professor status 1964-1969 at the Cooper Union.
